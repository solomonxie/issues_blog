# Kindergarten Maths 幼儿园数学入门
> Study notes mainly from Khan Academy.  Not literally for Kindergarten maths only, but also including all K12 math subjects.

#### `KHAN ACADEMY MASTERY` rules collected:
- 1 `skill` means 1 practice subject, could be found at `practice page` on the subject.
- 1 `skill` includes 4 to 7 `questions`.
- 1 `skill` finished 75%, will promote to `Practiced`.
- 1 `skill` finished 100%, will promote to `LEVEL ONE`.
- 1 `skill` **must be** `practiced` to join the `Mastery challenge`.
- 1 `question` correct on `Mastery challenge`, the related `skill` will get **1 level up**.
- 1 `question` incorrect on `Mastery challenge`, the related `skill` will get **1 level down**.
- 1 `quiz` finished in course section, the correct `skills` will promote to `LEVEL ONE`.
- 1 `unit test` finished in course section, the correct `skill` will get **1 level up till MASTERY**. Incorrect answer will get **1 level down**.
