# user-content

A personal public dump for all media files like blog images or pdfs or any heavy stuff. 
Concidering the future use of building a github blog, or tweets, or notebook, there'll be a whole lot of images and other media files will be created or referenced.
Thought rather than they flow with their each repo, it'd be better to gather them to a same place, which is way much reliable and easy to be managed.
And also it has unlimited space and unlimited web access.
It can be use anywhere I like.
I can create markdown articles everywhere without worrying about the issue of storing images.
