# What is a Git Reference?

> So Basically, a `git ref` is just an **"alias"** of a commit hash key like `d914f` for each branch's _newest_ commit (HEAD).

[Refer to: Deep dive into git: Git refs](https://aboullaite.me/deep-dive-into-git-git-refs/)

For example, I have a `fix-decoding` branch, and the hash key for its HEAD (newest commit) is `d914f9ad7d6547167f2f182ba7daa7174431b7ed`. 
What git does for our convenience is to create an _alias_ for that as a file at `.git/refs/heads/fix-decoding`, which has only the content `d914f9ad7d6547167f2f182ba7daa7174431b7ed`.
