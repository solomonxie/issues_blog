# How to use `Tig` like a boss [DRAFT]


## Show Git References

What are `git refs`?
In a brief, a `ref` is just an _**alias**_ for the `commit-ID` of a branch's latest commit.

In any mode of `tig`, you simply press `r` (reference) to see all the references:

## Browse the folder like a File Manager

Press `t` (tree) in any mode:

## Check Git Diffs like a boss

To check what differences a commit made, simply choose a commit and press `enter`:

To expand the diffs to full screen, press capital `O` (press `q` to leave).


## To add & commit changes

Press `s` to the `status` view, and interactively "move up" or "move down" by pressing `u`, which means to `add file to stage` or `remove file from stage`.

When you have choosed which files to commit, press capital `C` to commit (it will pop out the commit editor)
