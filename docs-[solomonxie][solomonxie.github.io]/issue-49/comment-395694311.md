[Refer to Khan academy: Integration by parts intro](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-antiderivatives-ftc/modal/v/deriving-integration-by-parts-formula)

Trick & Strategy:
- Recognize it's an integral with functions' product:
- Carefully choose which function to be `f(x)` and the other to be `g'(x)`.
- Better to choose  the **easier** one as `f(x)` when taking derivative.
