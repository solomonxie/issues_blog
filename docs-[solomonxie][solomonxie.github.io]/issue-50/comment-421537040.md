## Conditions for a goodness-of-fit test
- **Large counts condition**
All expected counts need to be at least **5**.
- 

### Example

Solve:
- The large counts condition says that all expected counts need to be at least 5
- Patrick needs to sample enough visits so that he expects each day of the week to appear at least 5 times. There are 7 days in the week, so he needs to sample at least 5*7=35 visits.


## `Expected counts`
Counting the **Expected counts** for data is the very first step and fundamental part of doing `Chi-square Test`.

> "For a χ² goodness-of-fit test, the null hypothesis is that the population distribution of the categorical variable in question matches some hypothesized distribution. We use that hypothesized distribution to calculate the expected counts for each value of the variable."

Solve:
- Since the _null hypothesis_ is 4 feeders has "equally likely" chance to feed the bird,
- so the supposed chance for each feeder would be `350/4 = 87.5`
- and 87.5 is the `Expected count` for each feeder.
