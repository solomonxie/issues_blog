# `Chi-square Goodness-of-fit Test`
> Goodness-of-fit Test is good for testing a `One-row Frequency Table`.
The test shows how well certain proportions fit our sample, which only has ONE variable(row).

Steps:
- Choose a distribution (depends on the DF)
- Complete the Frequency Table with `Expected Counts` for each data
- Calculate the standardized `Chi-square value` 𝐗² according to the _Expected_ & _Observed_
- Use calculator to get the probability area `P-value` in the distribution according to 𝐗²


## Conditions for a goodness-of-fit test
- **Large counts condition**
Each _Expected count_ need to be at least **5**. 
(No conditions attached to the _observed counts_)
- **Random condition**: The data came from a random sample from the population of interest, or a randomized experiment.
- **Independent condition**:  If we sample without replacement, our sample size should be less than **10%** of the population so we can assume independence between members in the sample. 

### Example

Solve:
- The large counts condition says that all expected counts need to be at least 5
- Patrick needs to sample enough visits so that he expects each day of the week to appear at least 5 times. There are 7 days in the week, so he needs to sample at least 5*7=35 visits.


## `Expected Frequencies`
Counting the **Expected Frequency** for data is the very first step and fundamental part of doing `Chi-square Test`.

The _expected frequencies_ can be either a **PRESET** or the **PROBABILITY** of the data.
The _expected frequencies_ are set as _Null Hypothesis_ in the test, 
and _Observed frequencies_ are the _Alternative Hypothesis_ against the null in the test.

> "For a χ² goodness-of-fit test, the null hypothesis is that the population distribution of the categorical variable in question matches some hypothesized distribution. We use that hypothesized distribution to calculate the expected counts for each value of the variable."

Solve:
- Since the _null hypothesis_ is 4 feeders has "equally likely" chance to feed the bird,
- so the supposed chance for each feeder would be `350/4 = 87.5`
- and 87.5 is the `Expected count` for each feeder.


## `Test statistic 𝐗²`


Chi-squared Test statistic Formula:

> How to understand the formula?
It's not hard to see this a way to **standardized** the data:
`(Observed - Expected)` gets the _Variation_,
`(...)²` eliminates the negative results,
`.../Expected` unweights the data, so that the value will fit to the Standardized Distribution, similar to the concepts of _Unit Circle_ or _Unit Vector_.

**To calculate 𝐗², we need to complete the Frequency Table, with both Expected and Observed values.**

## `P-value`

To calculate `P-value` we need the 𝐗² and _DF_:

- Compare Observed and expected, to get Chi-squared:

- Get a P-value calculator, input test statistic `𝐗²=10.5` and Degree of freedom `df= 4-1 = 3`:
