# Making conclusions about the difference of proportions


## `Confidence Interval` for `Hypothesis Test`

[Refer to Khan academy: Confidence interval for hypothesis test for difference in proportions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/two-sample-inference/modal/v/confidence-interval-for-hypothesis-test-for-difference-in-proportions)

In a two-sided test, the null hypothesis says there is no difference between the two proportions. In other words, the null hypothesis says that the difference between the two proportions is 0. 

We can use a confidence interval instead of a P-value for two-sided tests as long as the confidence level and significance level **add up to 100%**.

etc., we're asked to use a 90% confidence interval in a two-sided test with a significance level of α=0.10, which is fine. 
We look to see if the interval that estimates the difference contains 0 or not:

Notice that low P-values correspond to the conclusions when the interval excludes 0, and higher P-values correspond to the conclusions when the interval contains 0.
