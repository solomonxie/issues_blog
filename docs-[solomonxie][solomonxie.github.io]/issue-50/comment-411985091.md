## `Size of Sample Space`

Simply to **MULTIPLY**.

> The Fundamental Counting Principle: If there are `a` ways for one event to happen, and `b` ways for a second event to happen, then there are `a * b` ways for both events to happen.

Sample problem: If shoes come in 6 styles with 3 possible colors, how many varieties of shoes are there?
All you need to do is multiply: 6 â€¢ 3 = 18 possible varieties of shoes.
