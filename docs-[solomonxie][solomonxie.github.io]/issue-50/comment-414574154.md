# `Bernoulli Distribution`
> It is the `discrete probability distribution` of a random variable which takes the value `1` with probability p and the value `0` with probability `q=1-p`, that is, the probability distribution of any single experiment that asks a `yesâ€“no questio`n; 
the question results in a `boolean-valued outcome`, a single bit of information whose value is `success/yes/true/one` with probability `p` and `failure/no/false/zero` with probability `q`.

## `Bernoulli Distribution` vs. `Binomial Distribution`
[Refer to stackexchange: What is the difference and relationship between the binomial and Bernoulli distributions?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/838107/what-is-the-difference-and-relationship-between-the-binomial-and-bernoulli-distr/838122)

A Bernoulli random variable has two possible outcomes: 0 or 1. A binomial distribution is the sum of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables.
