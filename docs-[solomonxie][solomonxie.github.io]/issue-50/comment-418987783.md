# `T-Interval`
> When the _sample size_ comes to be very small (nâ‰¤30), the `Z-interval` for calculating _confidence interval_ becomes less reliable estimate. And here the `T-interval` comes into place.

`T interval` is good for situations where the sample size is **small** and population standard deviation is **unknown**.

[Refer to Khan academy: Small sample size confidence intervals](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/confidence-intervals-one-sample/modal/v/small-sample-size-confidence-intervals)

## `T-Distribution`
> The full name is `Student's t-distribution`, which is a _tweaked version of Normal Distribution_.

[Refer to wiki: Student's t-distribution](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Student%27s_t-distribution)

When the _sample size_ is small, the _Normal distribution_ will no longer be a good fit for estimating the population.
So we introduced the **tweaked version of Normal Distribution** for a small sample sized sampling data, which we called `T-distribution`.
