# `What is Random Variable`

> Instead of analyzing a **measured** distribution with explicit data, we're to **abstract** those analysis methods with **uncertain** data.
It's like **abstracting `arithmetic` to `algebra`**.

`Random Variables` are just like the **unknowns** in algebra. Except it's slightly different in Statistics.

Remember that: Studying `Random Variables` is just like studying `Algebra` over Arithmetic.

Random Variables are denoted by capital letters: **_X, Y, Z_**

## `Expected Value` of a Random Variable
> It's also known as the `Expectation`, `Mathematical Expectation`, `EV`, `Average`, `Mean Value`, `Mean`, or `First Moment`.

[Refer to wiki: Expected value](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Expected_value)

"In probability theory, the expected value of a random variable, intuitively, is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents."
