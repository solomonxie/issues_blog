# `What is Random Variable`
> Instead of analyzing a **measured** distribution with explicit data, we're to **abstract** those analysis methods with **uncertain** data.
It's like **abstracting `arithmetic` to `algebra`**.

[Refer to Khan academy: Random variables](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/modal/v/random-variables)
[`▶︎ Jump over to Khan academy for practice: Constructing probability distributions`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/modal/e/constructing-probability-distributions)


`Random Variables` are just like the **unknowns** in algebra. Except it's slightly different in Statistics.

Remember that: Studying `Random Variables` is just like studying `Algebra` over Arithmetic.

Random Variables are denoted by capital letters: **_X, Y, Z_**

## Types of Random Variable
[Refer to Khan academy: Discrete and continuous random variables](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/modal/v/discrete-and-continuous-random-variables)

- Discrete Random Variable
    - Binomial Random Variable
    - Geometric Random Variable
- Continuous Random Variable

"Discrete" literally means "Distinct" or "Separate" values.

The most useful one for real life is the `Discrete Distribution`, and we're gonna talk about it mostly.


## `Expected Value` of a Random Variable
> It's also known as the `Expectation`, `Mathematical Expectation`, `EV`, `Average`, `Mean Value`, `Mean`, or `First Moment`.

[Refer to wiki: Expected value](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Expected_value)

"In probability theory, the expected value of a random variable, intuitively, is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents."
