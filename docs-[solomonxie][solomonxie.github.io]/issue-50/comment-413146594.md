### Example

Solve:
- Notice that the probability of `x>3` is the **area** of the triangle between 3 and 5.
- So `P(x>3) = Area(3 to 5) = 1/2 * (5-3) * 0.6 = 0.6`


## Probability in Normal Density Curves

Solve:
- We know the Probability Distribution is a **Normal Distribution**.
- For the probability of `X<1`, we're to get the **area** of `X<1`.

- So the the `Z-score` at `X=1` is necessary for calculation. 
- `Z-score = (X-μ)/σ = (1 - 1)/0.05 = 0`
- Take a look at `Z-score table`, we know that the probability of `0` is 0.5.
