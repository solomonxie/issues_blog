# `Chi-Squared Testing`
> _Chi_ is written as greek letter `𝐗`, looks like x, reads "kai".
_Chi-squared_ is written as `𝐗²`.

Like **Z-score** in a _Normal Distribution_ for a _Z-test_, 
**T-score** in a _T-Distribution_ for a _T-test_, 
𝐗² is the "Test statistic" in _Chi-square Test_, which converts sample data to a **standardized value** in a _Chi-square Distribution_.

> _Chi-square Test_ is a hypothesis test for categorical data.

## `Type 1: Chi-square Goodness-of-Fit Test`
> Tests how well certain proportions fit our sample, which only has ONE variable(row).

## `Type 2: Tests of Independence`
> Look to see whether being a member of ONE CATEGORY is **independent** of THE OTHER, which has TWO variables (rows).

## `Type 3: Tests of Homogeneity`
> It's looking at whether it's likely that **Different samples** come from the **Same population**.
