## `Geometric vs. Binomial Random Variables`

The only difference between `Geometric R.V.` and `Binomial R.V.` is that, 
**The Geometric R.V. DOES NOT have a fixed number of trails.**

Requirements of Geometric R.V.:
- `p`: same probability `p` of each trail.
- Yes-no question: each trail's outcome is either success or failure.
- Independent: each trail is independent to each other.
