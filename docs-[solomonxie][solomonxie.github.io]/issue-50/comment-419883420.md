# `Power of Testing`
> _Power_ is a conditional probability of _REJECTING a FALSE HYPOTHESIS_.

_"power -> power of justice -> ability to remove the bad one"_

## `How to increase Power`
**Power is the likelihood that our sample result leads us to correctly reject a false null hypothesis.**

The **main purpose** of studying the power is to get more chance to do the RIGHT thing.

There're two main settings affect the _power_ of a significance test:
- Significance level: positive impact
- Sample size: positive impact

### Impact of Significance Level

Note that, the Power is a `Conditional Probability`, on the condition of `False null hypothesis`.

> That being said, the distribution is NOT built on the `null hypothesis is true` anymore, but on the `null hypothesis is false`.

- **Lower** significance level -> closer -> smaller "reject region" -> less chance to reject
- **Higher** significance level -> farther -> larger "reject region" -> more chance to reject

### Impact of Sample Size
**Larger sample sizes increase power.**
