# `Significant Difference Test` (Means)


## `Paired T Test` vs. `Two-sample T Test`
Consider the design of the study:
- Use a **paired test** if the study paired subjects in some way, or if the study compares two measurements on each subject.
- Use a **two-sample test** if the data were produced from two independent groups.

### Example

Solve:
- Each one in the sample is **either** left-handed or right-handed, so they're in different groups, which tells us we're gonna use `Two-sample Test` in this case
- It's asking for `Alternative hypothesis`, so it's:
