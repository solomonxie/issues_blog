## `Type 𝐈 & Type 𝐈𝐈 Errors`
> _Type I & Type II Errors_ are _conditional probabilities_ given the hypothesis is true or false.

[Refer to Khan academy: Introduction to Type I and Type II errors](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/significance-tests-one-sample/modal/v/introduction-to-type-i-and-type-ii-errors)

What will happen when we're to _reject_ a hypothesis?
- Reject the truth: `Type I Error`
- Not reject the truth
- Reject the false: `Power`
- Not reject the false: `Type II Error`

The good thing to do is to `Reject the false` and `Not reject the truth`.
The bad thing (error) to do is to `Reject the truth` and `Not reject the false`, which are called the `Type I Error` and `Type II Error`.

Since either `Type I Error` or `Type II Error` is the mistake we made while calculating the utmost chance of **truth** happening, so the `Error = p value`.


- `Type I  Error` is in a **"world"** that the _null hypothesis_ is **true**.
- `Type II Error` is in a **"world"** that the _null hypothesis_ is **false**.

## `Power in Significance Tests`
> _Power_ is a conditional probability of _REJECTING a FALSE HYPOTHESIS_.

_"power -> power of justice -> ability to remove the bad one"_

## `How to increase Power`
**Power is the likelihood that our sample result leads us to correctly reject a false null hypothesis.**

Therefore, we are to study how to **INCREASE** the power so that we'll get more chance to do the RIGHT thing.

There're two main settings affect the _power_ of a significance test:
- Significance level: positive impact
- Sample size: positive impact

### Impact of Significance Level
`Rejecting a false null hypothesis` is _more_ likely to happen with a **HIGHER** significance level and _less_ likely to happen with a **LOWER** significance level, since rejecting with lower significance requires our sample result to be farther away from the null hypothesis.

- **Higher** significance level -> **further** away from the
