## `Type 𝐈 & Type 𝐈𝐈 Errors`
> _Type I & Type II Errors_ are _conditional probabilities_ given the hypothesis is true or false.

[Refer to Khan academy: Introduction to Type I and Type II errors](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/significance-tests-one-sample/modal/v/introduction-to-type-i-and-type-ii-errors)

What will happen when we're to _reject_ a hypothesis?
- Reject the truth: `Type I Error`
- Not reject the truth
- Reject the false: `Power`
- Not reject the false: `Type II Error`

The good thing to do is to `Reject the false` and `Not reject the truth`.
The bad thing (error) to do is to `Reject the truth` and `Not reject the false`, which are called the `Type I Error` and `Type II Error`.


## `Hypothesis World` & `Alternative World`

Although both of them are **mistakes** for doing the right thing, but they're under totally opposite conditions:
**One is existing in the `Hypothesis World`, the other in the `Alternative World`**

- `Type I  Error` is in a **"world"** that the _null hypothesis_ is actually **true**.
- `Type II Error` is in a **"world"** that the _null hypothesis_ is actually **false**.

Since they're "living in a different world", and they're `Conditional Probabilities`, so the calculation is different too:
