# `Calculating Confidence Interval`

> Calculating the _Confidence Interval_ basically is just to convert a _confidence level_ , say 95%,  to a real value range, etc., (13kg, 28kg).

There're a few ways to calculate:
- Traditional Normal-based
- Informal
- Bootstrapping

We use the traditional Normal-based method more often.

Assume we've decided which _population statistic_ we'll be estimating, 
and which _level of confidence_ we need it to be,
then there're 2 steps to calculate the _Confidence Interval_:
1. Find the Sampling Distribution
2. Find the Confidence Limits



### Finding the Sampling Distribution
We know for constructing a Sampling Distribution we need the **Mean & Variance**:

Since the _population variance_ `𝜎²` is **UNKNOWN** to us,
so we are to **estimate** the _population variance_ by the sample's `Point Estimator`, which is `s²` in this case.

We assume the Sampling Distribution is **normally distributed**.

### Finding the Confidence Limits
