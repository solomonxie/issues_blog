# `Binomial Variables`

[Refer to article: Binomial Random Variables](http://bolt.mph.ufl.edu/6050-6052/unit-3b/binomial-random-variables/)

## Requirements
The **requirements** for a random experiment to be a binomial experiment are:
- A **fixed number** of trials as `n`.
- Each trial must be **independent** of the others.
- Each trial has only **TWO** possible outcomes: “success” or “failure“.
- Probability of success for each trial is a **constant `p`**, and the probability of failure is `1-p`.

## Examples of binomials
- A fair coin is flipped 20 times; X represents the number of heads.
**X is binomial with n = 20 and p = 0.5.**
- You roll a fair die 50 times; X is the number of times you get a six.
**X is binomial with n = 50 and p = 1/6.**
- The probability of having blood type B is 0.1. Choose 4 people at random; X is the number with blood type B.
**X is binomial with n = 4 and p = 0.1.**
- Draw 3 cards at random, one after the other, with replacement, from a set of 4 cards consisting of one club, one diamond, one heart, and one spade; X is the number of diamonds selected. Sampling with replacement ensures independence.
**X is binomial with n = 3 and p = 1/4**
- Approximately 1 in every 20 children has a certain disease. Let X be the number of children with the disease out of a random sample of 100 children. Although the children are sampled without replacement, it is assumed that we are sampling from such a vast population that the selections are virtually independent.
**X is binomial with n = 100 and p = 1/20 = 0.05.**

## Examples of non-binomials
- Roll a fair die repeatedly; X is the number of rolls it takes to get a six.
**X is not binomial, because the number of trials is not fixed.**
- A student answers 10 quiz questions completely at random; the first five are true/false, the second five are multiple choice, with four options each. X represents the number of correct answers.
**X is not binomial, because p changes from 1/2 to 1/4.**
- Draw 3 cards at random, one after the other, without replacement, from a set of 4 cards consisting of one club, one diamond, one heart, and one spade; X is the number of diamonds selected.
**X is not binomial, because the selections are not independent. (The probability (p) of success is not constant, because it is affected by previous selections.)**
