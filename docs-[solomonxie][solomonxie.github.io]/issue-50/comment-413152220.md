# Transforming random variables

## Shift
The **addition** or **subtraction** of `Random Variable X` will have these effects:
- Mean: Shift by the same value with X.
- Variance: Maintain the same.

## Scale
The scale of `Random Variable X` will have these effects:
- Mean: Scale by the same value with X.
- Variance: Scale by the same value with X.


### Example

Solve:
- Effect on mean(μ): `μY = 10(μX) + 5 = 24.5`, because mean will be effected by both **shift** & **scale**.
- Effect on Standard deviation(σ): `σY = 10μX = 8`, because σ will only be effected by **scale**.
