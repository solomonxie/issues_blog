# `Operations of Random Variables`
> Some basic "algebraic" operations, like adding/multiplying a number, or combining different R.V.s

## `Shift`
The **addition** or **subtraction** of `Random Variable X` will have these effects:
- Mean: Shift by the same value with X.
- Variance: Maintain the same.

## `Scale`
The scale of `Random Variable X` will have these effects:
- Mean: Scale by the same value with X.
- Variance: Scale by the same value with X.

Solve:
- Effect on mean(μ): `μY = 10(μX) + 5 = 24.5`, because mean will be effected by both **shift** & **scale**.
- Effect on Standard deviation(σ): `σY = 10μX = 8`, because σ will only be effected by **scale**.


## `Combining Random Variables`

Important facts about combining variances:
- The variables must be independent to each other.
- We can find the `standard deviation` by taking square root √ of the combined variances.
- The variance **increases** even when we subtract random variables.
- If both Random Variables are **normally distributed**, then the `Difference of them` will also be **normally distributed**.
