# `p-value` (One-tailed)
> p-value stands for _"Probability value"_.

[Refer to youtube: Hypothesis Testing 5: p values (one sample t test)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WojcyhC7EVc)

**_p-value_ tells how much of the "truth" takes part in your story.**

For example, you said your IQ is 130. So we build a **MODEL** based on your claim. And then we ask you to take a real IQ test which tells your IQ is 117. So the calculation tells that the **REAL** part only takes 0.47% in your "story". Therefore, we have a conclusion that, if there is only 0.47% truth in a story, we can claim the story is a **LIE**! And 0.47% is the `p-value`.


## `How to understand p-value`
> It's saying that, based on your theory, the reality is almost impossible with 0.49% of chance occurs. But reality is reality, in another word, it's more about saying the theory itself is so wrong.

Why do we count the _proportion of the tail_ instead of the proportion in between of the theory & reality?
_proportion of the tail_ represents the _reality value adding up with all the "more rare" values, that kinda makes sense.

> It tells **how rare** your data is if the _null hypothesis_ was true.That being said, _p-value_ is the measure of the strength of the evidence **against** the _null hypothesis_.

The smaller the _p-value_, the greater the evidence against the _null hypothesis_.

- First we assume the original assumption (__null hypothesis__) is **true**
- and we build a _normal distribution_ on the hypothesis
- then we take a sample and calculate statistic on it
- followed by drawing the _sample statistic_ on the "_hypothesis distribution_"
- so we calculate the **proportion of the tail** from the point we drew for the _sample statistic_.
- finally we get the **probability**, as the `p-value`.

## `p-value` & `Conditional Probability`
> p-value is a **`Conditional Probability`**.
