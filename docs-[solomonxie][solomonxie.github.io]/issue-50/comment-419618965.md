# `Null Hypothesis Significance Testing`

We design a `Significance Test` to evaluate the strength of the evidence against some **null hypothesis**. 
The **alternative hypothesis**  is the claim we are trying to find evidence in favor of.



## `Significance Level ⍺` (Threshold)

For making a "judge" on wether the hypothesis stands or fails, we need a standard or threshold to judge it, which we called the `Significance Level`, or the `Cutoff`, denoted `⍺` (alpha).

There are a few common sets on the _significance level_:
- \<1%: Very strong evidence against our claim.
- \<5%: Strong evidence against our claim.
- \<10%: Weak evidence against our claim.
- \>10%: Little or no evidence against our claim.

## `p-value`
> p-value stands for _"Probability value"_.

[Refer to youtube: Hypothesis Testing 5: p values (one sample t test)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WojcyhC7EVc)

_p-value_ is the probability of the **ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS**, in the Sampling Distribution which centred at the _Null hypothesis_.

What does it mean?
For example, we assume the _null hypothesis_ is true, and set `H₀ = 30`, 


> It tells **how rare** your data is if the _null hypothesis_ was true.That being said, _p-value_ is the measure of the strength of the evidence **against** the _null hypothesis_.

The smaller the _p-value_, the greater the evidence against the _null hypothesis_.

> p-value is a **`Conditional Probability`**.

### `How to understand p-value`
> It's saying that, based on your theory, the reality is almost impossible with 0.49% of chance occurs. But reality is reality, in another word, it's more about saying the theory itself is so wrong.

Why do we count the _proportion of the tail_ instead of the proportion in between of the theory & reality?
_proportion of the tail_ represents the _reality value adding up with all the "more rare" values, that kinda makes sense.

- First we assume the original assumption (__null hypothesis__) is **true**
- and we build a _normal distribution_ on the hypothesis
- then we take a sample and calculate statistic on it
- followed by drawing the _sample statistic_ on the "_hypothesis distribution_"
- so we calculate the **proportion of the tail** from the point we drew for the _sample statistic_.
- finally we get the **probability**, as the `p-value`.
