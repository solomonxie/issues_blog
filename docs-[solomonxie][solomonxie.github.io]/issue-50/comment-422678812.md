# Inference on Linear Regression

## Conditions for inference on slope (`L-I-N-E-R`)
It can be concluded as `L-I-N-E-R`:
- `L`: Linear condition (Has linear relationship between x&y )
- `I`: Independent condition (Individual observations with replacement or 10% Rule)
- `N`: Normal condition (Sample size is at least 30)
- `E`: Equal variance condition
- `R`: Random condition


## Confidence interval for slope

Here's the formula for a _t interval_ estimating slope:

Solve:



## `T statistic for Slope`


## `P-value for Slope`


## `Use CI to test Slope`
