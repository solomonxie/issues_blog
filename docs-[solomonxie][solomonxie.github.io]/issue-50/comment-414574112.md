# What is Random Variables

> Instead of analyzing a **measured** distribution with explicit data, we're to **abstract** those analysis methods with **uncertain** data.
It's like **abstracting `arithmetic` to `algebra`**.

`Random Variables` are just like the **unknowns** in algebra. Except it's slightly different in Statistics.

Remember that: Studying `Random Variables` is just like studying `Algebra` over Arithmetic.
