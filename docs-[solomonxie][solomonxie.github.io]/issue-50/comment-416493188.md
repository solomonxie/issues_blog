## `Probabilities with Sample Proportions`

It's just to find out the probability area in the Normal Distribution.
All you need is the Mean, Standard Deviation and the point you're to measure.

### Example

Solve:
- Calculate the mean of sample proportion is `0.63`
- Calculate the standard deviation of sample proportion is `0.019`
- Use an online Normal Distribution calculator, set up the upper boundary as `0.60`
- Get the probability area is about `0.06`
