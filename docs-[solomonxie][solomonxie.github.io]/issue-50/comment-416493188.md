# `Sample Proportion`

[Refer to article: The Sample Proportion](http://www.stat.wmich.edu/s216/book/node68.html)

`Sample Proportion` is the **proportion of success** in a sample.

`Sample Proportion` is a **Binomial Random Variable** problem, 
so let **X** denotes the _number of success_ in the sample, which is the **Binomial Random Variable** with parameter _n_ and _p_,

Why is that?
Remember that the _Mean_ and _Variance_ of a Binomial Variable is:

Since **X** is our _expected value_, which then is the _Mean_, so `X = μx = np`

## `Probabilities with Sample Proportions`

It's just to find out the probability area in the Normal Distribution.
All you need is the Mean, Standard Deviation and the point you're to measure.

### Example

Solve:
- Calculate the mean of sample proportion is `0.63`
- Calculate the standard deviation of sample proportion is `0.019`
- Use an online Normal Distribution calculator, set up the upper boundary as `0.60`
- Get the probability area is about `0.06`
