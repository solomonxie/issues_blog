## `Expected counts`

- Intuitively, we just need to get the **Ratio** from the Total counts, and apply the ratio to the corresponding cell, as what we **expected**.
- In general, it can be calculated with this formula:

Solve:
- For the intuition, we just look at the Frequency Table, and get the _Ratio from total counts_, which is `65/262` in this case
- and apply the ratio to the Row total, which is `90` in this case, so it's `(65/262) * 90`
- Or we can just use the formula:

- which gets us:
