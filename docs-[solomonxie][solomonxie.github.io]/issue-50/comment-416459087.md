## Probability of sample mean exceeding a value

[Refer to Khan academy: Example: Probability of sample mean exceeding a value](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/sampling-distributions-library/modal/v/sampling-distribution-example-problem)


### Example

Solve:
- The Sample Size is too small, which is hard to make the Sample Distribution normal.
- It didn't tell the Parent Distribution's shape, so there's no way to tell if the Sample Distribution can match the parent shape as normal shape.



## `Standard Error` (SE)
> `Standard Error` is actually a short version of saying the `Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution`.

[Refer to wiki: Standard error](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Standard_error)

### `Standard Error of Sample Mean` (SEM)
If we're to find the `Standard Deviation of the Mean of a Sampling Distribution`, we call it as the `Standard Error of the Mean` (SEM).

[Refer to Khan academy: Standard error of the Mean](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/sampling-distributions-library/modal/v/standard-error-of-the-mean)

_Standard Error_ gives us **how far the Sample Mean will deviate from the true mean**.
