# `Sample Distribution`
It's just taking out the **parameters**(Mean/SD..) from different samples of the SAME population, and make them as a distribution. etc., _Distribution of means_,  _Distribution of standard deviations_...

## `Sample Statistic Bias`
[Refer to Khan academy: Sample statistic bias worked example](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/sampling-distribution-ap/modal/v/sample-statistic-bias-worked-example)

- Unbiased Sample Estimation: The distribution is roughly symmetric about the real parameter of population.
- Biased Sample Estimation: The sample distribution is NOT symmetric about the real parameter of population.
