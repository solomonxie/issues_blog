## 「Probability of sample mean」 exceeding a value

[Refer to Khan academy: Example: Probability of sample mean exceeding a value](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/sampling-distributions-library/modal/v/sampling-distribution-example-problem)

Solve:
- The Sample Size is too small, which is hard to make the Sample Distribution normal.
- It didn't tell the Parent Distribution's shape, so there's no way to tell if the Sample Distribution can match the parent shape as normal shape.
