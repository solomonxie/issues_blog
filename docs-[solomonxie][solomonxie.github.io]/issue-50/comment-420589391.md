## Pooling the proportion of successes
In this type of test, it's useful to first calculate the pooled (or combined) proportion of successes in both samples:

We do significance tests assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In this test, our null hypothesis is that the two population proportions are equal, but we don't have a hypothesized value for their common proportion. Our best estimate for this value is Ṕc. We'll use this pooled (or combined) value in the standard error formula where we'd ideally use each population proportion.
