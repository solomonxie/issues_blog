# `Significant Difference Test`
> which is actually the "_Hypothesis Test for difference_", and sounds more intuitive with _significant different test_ because it's testing for a significant different.

[Refer to Khan academy: Hypothesis test for difference in proportions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/two-sample-inference/modal/v/hypothesis-test-for-difference-in-proportions)

The `Hypothesis difference` is 0 when `H₀: p1 - p2 = 0`.


## Combining the proportion of successes
In this type of test, it's useful to first calculate the pooled (or combined) proportion of successes in both samples:

We do significance tests assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In this test, our null hypothesis is that the two population proportions are equal, but we don't have a hypothesized value for their common proportion. Our best estimate for this value is Ṕc. We'll use this pooled (or combined) value in the standard error formula where we'd ideally use each population proportion.
