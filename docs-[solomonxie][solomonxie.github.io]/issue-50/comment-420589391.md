## Combining the proportion of successes
In this type of test, it's useful to first calculate the pooled (or combined) proportion of successes in both samples:

We do significance tests assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In this test, our null hypothesis is that the two population proportions are equal, but we don't have a hypothesized value for their common proportion. Our best estimate for this value is á¹”c. We'll use this pooled (or combined) value in the standard error formula where we'd ideally use each population proportion.
