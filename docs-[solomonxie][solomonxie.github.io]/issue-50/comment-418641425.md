# One-sample z interval


## Conditions for a valid Confidence Interval

### The random condition
The sample data has to be randomly picked.

### The normal condition
The normal condition says that we need at least 10 successes and 10 failures in our sample data. 

### The independence condition
The independence condition says that when sampling without replacement, we can still treat each observation in the sample as independent as long as we sample less than 10%, percent of the population.
