# `Significance Testing`
> Also called the `Null Hypothesis Significance Testing`.

We design a `Significance Test` to evaluate the strength of the evidence against some **null hypothesis**. 
The **alternative hypothesis**  is the claim we are trying to find evidence in favor of.

The _Significance Test_ involves with these concepts:
- _Null hypothesis_ & _Alternative hypothesis_
- _p-value_
- _Significance Level_
- _Type I & Type II Error_
- _Power_

## `Significance Level ‚ç∫` (Threshold)

For making a "judge" on wether the hypothesis stands or fails, we need a standard or threshold to judge it, which we called the `Significance Level`, or the `Cutoff`, denoted `‚ç∫` (alpha).

There are a few common sets on the _significance level_:
- \<1%: Very strong evidence against our claim.
- \<5%: Strong evidence against our claim.
- \<10%: Weak evidence against our claim.
- \>10%: Little or no evidence against our claim.

## `p-value`
**p-value tells the MAXIMUM of the "truth" takes part in your story.**

## `Type ùêà & Type ùêàùêà Errors`

[Refer to Khan academy: Introduction to Type I and Type II errors](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/significance-tests-one-sample/modal/v/introduction-to-type-i-and-type-ii-errors)

What will happen when we're to _reject_ a hypothesis?
- **Reject the truth**
- Not reject the truth
- Reject the false
- **Not reject the false**

The good thing to do is to `Reject the false` and `Not reject the truth`.
The bad thing (error) to do is to `Reject the truth` and `Not reject the false`, which are called the `Type I Error` and `Type II Error`.

Since either `Type I Error` or `Type II Error` is the mistake we made while calculating the utmost chance of **truth** happening, so the `Error = p value`.
