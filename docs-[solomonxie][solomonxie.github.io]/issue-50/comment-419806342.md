# `Significance Testing`
> Also called the `Null Hypothesis Significance Testing`.

We design a `Significance Test` to evaluate the strength of the evidence against some **null hypothesis**. 
The **alternative hypothesis**  is the claim we are trying to find evidence in favor of.



## `Significance Level ⍺` (Threshold)

For making a "judge" on wether the hypothesis stands or fails, we need a standard or threshold to judge it, which we called the `Significance Level`, or the `Cutoff`, denoted `⍺` (alpha).

There are a few common sets on the _significance level_:
- \<1%: Very strong evidence against our claim.
- \<5%: Strong evidence against our claim.
- \<10%: Weak evidence against our claim.
- \>10%: Little or no evidence against our claim.
