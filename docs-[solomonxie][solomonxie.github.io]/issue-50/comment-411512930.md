# `Least-square Regression`
> _Least-square Regression_ is one way of calculating _Linear Regression_. 
Most regressions' calculations are done by **computer**, but we want to do that by hand to have better understanding.

What is Linear Regression?
Trying to fit a line as closely as possible, and as many of points as possible, is called "Linear Regression".

## `Residuals`
A _residual_ is an "Error", which is the **VERTICAL DISTANCE** from the actual value to the Regression Line.

At a certain X-position, the `residual` is:
`Residual = Y - Ŷ`
in which Y is its **actual y value**, and Ŷ is the **y value on regression line**.

So when the `residual` is **positive**, the **actual point** is **ABOVE** the `regression line`,
and when the `residual` is **negative**, the **actual point** is **BELOW** the `regression line`.

The way that we calculate the `Regression Line` with `Least Square` method, is to **MINIMIZE** the **square of residuals**.

1. As we said the `Correlation Coefficient r` is kind like the **`Unit Slope`** which is between `-1 to 1`, so we have to apply the `unit slope` in real case by multiply `r` with the **ratio** of Standard Deviation of `y` & `x`, which is `Sy/Sx`.
2. A "must go through point" is the **MEAN** of the dataset, which is: `(Ẋ, Ẏ)`. At the mean, the `residual = actual`

With two informations above, we can easily calculate out the estimated Regression Line.


### Why are we squaring residuals?
It's just a way to keep those `residuals` (difference from the regression line) **positive**.
And actually the `residuals` or `squared residuals` DOESN'T really matter to us, 
because we're to **MINIMIZE** them anyway. Take the minimum residual or minimum residual squared doesn't matter.
