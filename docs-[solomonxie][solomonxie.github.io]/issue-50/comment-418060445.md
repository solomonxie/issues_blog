# `Confidence Interval` (CI)
> Since there will always be _sampling error_ for estimating the true population, 
so it's a good practice to have a **confidence interval** while doing estimation on samples.

[Refer to youtube: Understanding Confidence Intervals: Statistics Help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWsuO9f74o)
[Refer to article: Confidence Level & Margin of Error](http://www.geoib.com/confidence-level--margin-of-error.html)

A _Confidence Interval_ is an **estimated RANGE of values** that seem reasonable, which controls how **accurate** the estimation to be.

> We've learnt how to estimate an **exact** value for Population parameters. But the estimation can't be too good if it's exact. Hence _confidence interval_ gives a more reliable way to describe/guess the population.

## `Inference & Inferential Statistics`
Inference means the **conclusions** we got from the _sample_ to describe the _population_ .


## `Confidence Level`
_Confidence Level_ is a **decision** we made, that how much precise we want the guessing to be.
95% is the confidence level people often use.

Width of Confidence Interval:
The _width of confidence interval_ will be affected by two things:
- Variation
- Sample Size

## `Point Estimator`
A _point estimate_ of a population parameter is a single value used to estimate the population parameter. For example, the sample mean _x_ is a point estimate of the population mean _μ_.

_Point Estimator_ is often set to be the _Sample Mean_, as the **Centre** of _Confidence Interval_.



## `Sampling Error`
> It's also called "Variation due to sampling". 

Since the sample will NEVER BE PERFECT to represent the true population, so there will always be _Sampling error_.

- The **less** error allowed, the **less** confidence we are.
- The **greater** error allowed, the **more** confidence we are.

## `Standard Error` (SE)
> `Standard Error` is actually a short version of saying the `Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution`.

[Refer to wiki: Standard error](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Standard_error)
[Refer to Khan academy: Standard error of the Mean](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/sampling-distributions-library/modal/v/standard-error-of-the-mean)


If we're to find the `Standard Deviation of the Mean of a Sampling Distribution`, we call it as the `Standard Error of the Mean` (SEM).

## `Margin of Error` or `Confidence Limits`

We made up a decision of _confidence level_ we want it to be, 
and we set the **Sample Mean** as the CENTRE of the range, which slice the interval to half:

The confidence limits (min/max) is given by this formula, 
which uses the `Margin of Error`:

x = mean of the sample
z = z-score representing the size of the confidence interval you have set, measured in units of standard deviations from the mean
s = standard deviation of the sample
n = number of entries in the sample


What z-score should you use?
