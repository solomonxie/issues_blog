# `Confidence Interval`
> Since there will always be _sampling error_ for estimating the true population, 
so it's a good practice to have a **confidence interval** while doing estimation on samples.

[Refer to youtube: Understanding Confidence Intervals: Statistics Help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWsuO9f74o)


A _Confidence Interval_ controls how **accurate** the estimation to be.

## `Terms`

### `Inference`
Inference means the **conclusions** we got from the _sample_ to describe the _population_ .


### `Sampling Error`
> It's also called "Variation due to sampling". 

Since the sample will NEVER BE PERFECT to represent the true population, so there will always be _Sampling error_.

### `Standard Error` (SE)
> `Standard Error` is actually a short version of saying the `Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution`.

[Refer to wiki: Standard error](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Standard_error)
[Refer to Khan academy: Standard error of the Mean](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/sampling-distributions-library/modal/v/standard-error-of-the-mean)


If we're to find the `Standard Deviation of the Mean of a Sampling Distribution`, we call it as the `Standard Error of the Mean` (SEM).

### `Margin of Error`


## `Width of Confidence Interval`
The _width of confidence interval_ will be affected by two things:
- Variation
- Sample Size


## `Calculate Confidence Interval`
There're a few ways to calculate:
- Traditional Normal-based
- Informal
- Bootstrapping

We use the traditional Normal-based method more often.
