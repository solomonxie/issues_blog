# Probability Distribution for Random Variable

## A valid Probability Distribution
- All probabilities add up to 100%.
- All probabilities must be non-negative.


## Mean (Expected Value) of Discrete Random Variable
In the case of a discrete random variable, expected value or mean — denoted as `E(X)` or `μx` is the long-run average outcome. To find expected value, take each value, multiply it by its respective probability, and add up all the products.

(Where the sum of all possible value of `x`)

Solve:
- Apply the formula of Expected Value of Discrete Random Variable
- `μx = (-10*0.81) + (40*0.18( + (90*0.01) = 0`
