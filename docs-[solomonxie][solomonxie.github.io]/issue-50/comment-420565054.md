## `Conditions for inference on two proportions`
"same-o same-o".

The conditions we need for inference on one proportion are:
- **Random**:
The data needs to come from a random sample or randomized experiment.
- **Normal**:
The normal condition says that we need at least 10 successes and 10 failures in our sample data. 
- **Independent**:
The independence condition says that when sampling without replacement, we can still treat each observation in the sample as independent as long as we sample less than 10%, percent of the population.
