# `Cumulative Geometric Probability`

We know how to calculate Geometric Probability at each value, but `Cumulative G.P.` would be bit tricky.

**The formula literally means: FAIL a TIMES IN A ROW.**


This formula is good for `X>a`, and with a bit twist you can get most out of it.
etc., 
- `P(X≥4)` is the same with `P(X>3)`
- `P(X≤5)` is the same with `1 - P(X>5)`
- `P(X<7)` is the same with `1 - P(X>6)`


### Example

Solve:
- The easiest way is to apply the cumulative geometric probability formula:
- `P(X<5) = 1 - P(X>4) = 1 - Failure⁴ = 1-0.9^4 = 0.34`
- Another way is to calculate each item in the sequence:
`P(C≤4) = P(C=1) + P(C=2) + P(C=3) + P(C=4)`
- which we expand it to:
`P(C≤4) = 0.9⁰*0.1 + 0.9*0.1 + 0.9²*0.1 + 0.9³*0.1`
- We could easily recognize it as a standard `Geometric Series`, so we can apply the formula:
`P(C≤4) = 0.1 * (1-0.9⁴) / (1-0.9) = 0.34`

Solve:
- It's the same as "the probability of 5 failures in a row."
