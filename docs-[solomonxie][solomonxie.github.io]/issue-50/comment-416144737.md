# `Standard Error` (SE)
> `Standard Error` is actually a short version of saying the `Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution`.

### `Why is it an Error?`
Assume the _Population mean_ is 0, then the `Standard Error` is the error/distance of the _Sample Mean_ away from the _True population mean_.


### `What if we don't know the Population variance?`


### `Standard Error of Sample Mean` (SEM)
If we're to find the `Standard Deviation of the Mean of a Sampling Distribution`, we call it as the `Standard Error of the Mean` (SEM).

[Refer to Khan academy: Standard error of the Mean](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/sampling-distributions-library/modal/v/standard-error-of-the-mean)

_Standard Error_ gives us **how far the Sample Mean will deviate from the true mean**.
