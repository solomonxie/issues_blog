# `Null Hypothesis Significance Testing`

`Hypothesis Testing` is that we make a assumption, or a hypothesis about something, and we then make a test and do statistic on it as evidence to **against** the hypothesis. 

> We can **NEVER** prove the null hypothesis, because "INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY".

[Refer to youtube: What is a Hypothesis Test and a P-Value?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwWEa8wU_6U&t=381s)

`Null hypothesis significance testing` is first to assume the hypothesis is true, and 


## `Null Hypothesis` & `Alternative Hypothesis`

[Refer to youtube: Hypothesis Testing 2: null and alternative hypothesis (one sample t test)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1GV6nLnbyE)

Notations:
- H₀: Null Hypothesis (reads `H-knot`)
_Null hypothesis_ is the assumption we claimed as our opinion.
- Ha: Alternative Hypothesis (reads `H-alternative`)
_Alternative hypothesis_ is the **opposition** against the _null hypothesis_.

etc., if the _null hypothesis_ is "Jason's IQ is 130", then the _alternative hypothesis_ is "his IQ is below 130".


## `p-value`
> p-value stands for _Probability value_.

[Refer to youtube: Hypothesis Testing 5: p values (one sample t test)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WojcyhC7EVc)

_p-value_ is the probability of the null hypothesis occurring.

> It tells **how rare** your data is if the _null hypothesis_ was true.That being said, _p-value_ is the measure of the strength of the evidence **against** the _null hypothesis_.

The smaller the _p-value_, the greater the evidence against the _null hypothesis_.

> p-value is a **`Conditional Probability`**.

### `How to understand p-value`
> It's saying that, based on your theory, the reality is almost impossible with 0.49% of chance occurs. But reality is reality, in another word, it's more about saying the theory itself is so wrong.

- First we assume the original assumption (__null hypothesis__) is **true**
- and we build a _normal distribution_ on the hypothesis
- then we take a sample and calculate statistic on it
- followed by drawing the _sample statistic_ on the "_hypothesis distribution_"
- so we calculate the **proportion of the tail** from the point we drew for the _sample statistic_.
- finally we get the **probability**, as the `p-value`.

## `Significance Level ⍺` (Threshold)

For making a "judge" on wether the hypothesis stands or fails, we need a standard or threshold to judge it, which we called the `Significance Level`, or the `Cutoff`, denoted `⍺` (alpha).

There are a few common sets on the _significance level_:
- \<1%: Very strong evidence against our claim.
- \<5%: Strong evidence against our claim.
- \<10%: Weak evidence against our claim.
- \>10%: Little or no evidence against our claim.
