# `Hypothesis Testing`

`Hypothesis Testing` is that we make a assumption, or a hypothesis about something, and we then make a test and do statistic on it as evidence to **against** the hypothesis. 

> We can **NEVER** prove the null hypothesis, because "INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY".

## `Simple Hypothesis Testing`

### Example

Solve:
- According to the table, out of 100010001000 simulated samples:
    - 5 had 80%, percent satisfied customers
    - None had a lower measured percentage of satisfied customers
- In total, these sum up to 5 simulations out of 1000. Therefore, the simulations imply that the probability of having a sample with 80%, percent satisfied customers or less is:

- The probability we got is lower than 1%, percent. Therefore, we should reject the hypothesis.

Solve:
- Assume the 40% probability is **TRUE**,
- so the probability of getting 3 wins in a row is: `40%^3 = 6.4%`
- Therefore we SHOULDN'T reject it, because it's higher than 5%.
