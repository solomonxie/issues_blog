# `Hypothesis Testing`

## `H₀ & Ha`
- H₀: Null Hypothesis (reads `H-knot`)
- Ha: Alternative Hypothesis (reads `H-alternative`)

## `Significance Level ⍺` (Threshold)

- 1%
- `5%`
- 10%


## `p-value`
> p-value stands for _Probability value_.

The _p-value_ is the **probability** of getting observed value of the `test statistic` or a value with even greater evidence against H₀, if the _null hypothesis_ is actually true.

That being said, _p-value_ is the measure of the strength of the evidence against the _null hypothesis_.

p-value is a **`Conditional Probability`**.
