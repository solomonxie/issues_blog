# `Hypothesis Testing`

_Hypothesis Testing_ is that we make a claim, a hypothesis about something, and we then make a test and do statistic on it as evidence to **support or against** the hypothesis. 

## `Null Hypothesis` & `Alternative Hypothesis`

Notations:
- H₀: Null Hypothesis (reads `H-knot`)
- Ha: Alternative Hypothesis (reads `H-alternative`)

_Null hypothesis_ is the hypothesis we claimed as our opinion.
_Alternative hypothesis_ is 

## `Significance Level ⍺` (Threshold)

For making a "judge" on wether the hypothesis stands or fails, we need a standard or threshold to judge it, which we called the `Significance Level`, denoted `ɑ` (alpha).

## `p-value`
> p-value stands for _Probability value_.

The _p-value_ is the **probability** of getting observed value of the `test statistic` or a value with even greater evidence against H₀, if the _null hypothesis_ is actually true.

That being said, _p-value_ is the measure of the strength of the evidence against the _null hypothesis_.

p-value is a **`Conditional Probability`**.

> The smaller the _p-value_, the greater the evidence against the _null hypothesis_.
