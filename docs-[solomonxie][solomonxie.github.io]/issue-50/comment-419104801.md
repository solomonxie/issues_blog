# `Hypothesis Testing`

`Hypothesis Testing` is that we make a assumption, or a hypothesis about something, and we then make a test and do statistic on it as evidence to **against** the hypothesis. 

> We can **NEVER** prove the null hypothesis, because "INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY".

[Refer to youtube: What is a Hypothesis Test and a P-Value?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwWEa8wU_6U&t=381s)


## `Null Hypothesis` & `Alternative Hypothesis`

[Refer to youtube: Hypothesis Testing 2: null and alternative hypothesis (one sample t test)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1GV6nLnbyE)

Notations:
- H₀: Null Hypothesis (reads `H-knot`)
_Null hypothesis_ is the assumption we claimed as our opinion.
- Ha: Alternative Hypothesis (reads `H-alternative`)
_Alternative hypothesis_ is the **opposition** against the _null hypothesis_.

etc., if the _null hypothesis_ is "Jason's IQ is 130", then the _alternative hypothesis_ is "his IQ is below 130".


## `Significance Level ⍺` (Threshold)

For making a "judge" on wether the hypothesis stands or fails, we need a standard or threshold to judge it, which we called the `Significance Level`, or the `Cutoff`, denoted `⍺` (alpha).

There are a few common sets on the _significance level_:
- \<1%: Very strong evidence against our claim.
- \<5%: Strong evidence against our claim.
- \<10%: Weak evidence against our claim.
- \>10%: Little or no evidence against our claim.

### `Critical Values` & `Rejection Regions`

## `Simple Hypothesis Testing`

### Example

Solve:
- According to the table, out of 100010001000 simulated samples:
    - 5 had 80%, percent satisfied customers
    - None had a lower measured percentage of satisfied customers
- In total, these sum up to 5 simulations out of 1000. Therefore, the simulations imply that the probability of having a sample with 80%, percent satisfied customers or less is:

- The probability we got is lower than 1%, percent. Therefore, we should reject the hypothesis.

Solve:
- Assume the 40% probability is **TRUE**,
- so the probability of getting 3 wins in a row is: `40%^3 = 6.4%`
- Therefore we SHOULDN'T reject it, because it's higher than 5%.
