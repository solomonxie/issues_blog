# `Hypothesis Testing`

`Hypothesis Testing` is that we make a assumption, or a hypothesis about something, and we then make a test and do statistic on it as evidence to **against** the hypothesis. 

> We can **NEVER** prove the null hypothesis, because "INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY".

## `Null Hypothesis` & `Alternative Hypothesis`

[Refer to youtube: Hypothesis Testing 2: null and alternative hypothesis (one sample t test)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1GV6nLnbyE)

Notations:
- H₀: Null Hypothesis (reads `H-knot`)
_Null hypothesis_ is the assumption we claimed as our opinion.
- Ha: Alternative Hypothesis (reads `H-alternative`)
_Alternative hypothesis_ is the **opposition** against the _null hypothesis_.

etc., if the _null hypothesis_ is "Jason's IQ is 130", then the _alternative hypothesis_ is "his IQ is below 130".


### The Null Hypothesis H₀
The _null hypothesis_ should always contain a statement of equality. Another way of thinking of it is that the null hypothesis is a statement of "no difference." 
We can write the null hypothesis in the form:
- `H₀: parameter = value`


### The Alternative Hypothesis Ha
The alternative hypothesis could take one of three forms, depending on the context of the test:
- `Ha: parameter > value`
- `Ha: parameter < value`
- `Ha: parameter ≠ value`

## `Simple Hypothesis Testing`

### Example

Solve:
- According to the table, out of 100010001000 simulated samples:
    - 5 had 80%, percent satisfied customers
    - None had a lower measured percentage of satisfied customers
- In total, these sum up to 5 simulations out of 1000. Therefore, the simulations imply that the probability of having a sample with 80%, percent satisfied customers or less is:

- The probability we got is lower than 1%, percent. Therefore, we should reject the hypothesis.

Solve:
- Assume the 40% probability is **TRUE**,
- so the probability of getting 3 wins in a row is: `40%^3 = 6.4%`
- Therefore we SHOULDN'T reject it, because it's higher than 5%.
