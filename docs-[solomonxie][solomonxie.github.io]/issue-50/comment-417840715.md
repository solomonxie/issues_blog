# `Central Limit Theorem`
> **Central Limit Theorem** is one of the most fundamental & profound concepts in Statistics or even Mathematics.

[Refer to youtube: Introduction to the Central Limit Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pujol1yC1_A)
[Refer to Khan academy: Central limit theorem](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/sampling-distributions-library/modal/v/central-limit-theorem)

The theorem is about the `Sample Mean`, saying:

The distribution of Sample Mean tends towards the Normal Distribution as the Sample Size increases, **regardless** of the distribution from which we're sampling.

> **As a _very rough guidline_, the Sample Mean is approximately Normally distributed if the Sample Size is at least 30.**

That being said:
- If the `Sample Size < 30`, the shape of Sample Mean Distribution will be matching the shape of Population Distribution.
- If the `Sample Size â‰¥ 30`, the shape of Sample Mean Distribution will be **Normally distributed**, **regardless** what the shape of Population Distribution is.
