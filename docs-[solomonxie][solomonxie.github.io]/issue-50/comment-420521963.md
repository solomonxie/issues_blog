# `T Test` (t statistics)

[Refer to article: Understanding t-Tests: t-values and t-distributions](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/understanding-t-tests-t-values-and-t-distributions)

T-tests are all based on `t-values`. 
T-values are an example of what statisticians call `Test statistics`. A test statistic is a standardized value that is calculated from sample data during a hypothesis test. 
The procedure that calculates the test statistic compares your data to what is expected under the null hypothesis.

## `Formula of One-sample T test for Mean`
The test statistic gives us an idea of how far away our sample result is from our null hypothesis. 

For a one-sample t test for a mean, our test statistics is:

(x⁻ is the _Sample Mean_, μ₀ is mean from _null hypothesis_, sx is the _Sample SD_, n is _Sample size_)
