# `Bernoulli Distribution`
> It is the `discrete probability distribution` of a random variable which takes the value `1` with probability p and the value `0` with probability `q=1-p`, that is, the probability distribution of any single experiment that asks a `yes–no questio`n; 
the question results in a `boolean-valued outcome`, a single bit of information whose value is `success/yes/true/one` with probability `p` and `failure/no/false/zero` with probability `q`.
