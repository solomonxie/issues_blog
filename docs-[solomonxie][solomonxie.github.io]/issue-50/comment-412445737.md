# `Conditional Probability`

It's NOT just both events happened, it's asking the probability of one event **AFTER** another event happened.
It's based on a **happened** event, that's why you're to divide the probability of the happened event.

## Notation

`Probability of B given A` (B **after** A, or B in condition of A):

or `Probability of A given B`:

## Understanding the formula
[Refer to youtube: Probability Part 2: Updating Your Beliefs with Bayes: Crash Course Statistics #14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZCskBpHWyk)
### A GIVEN B
It means "A after B", or "A after B has happened".
Instead of happening at the same time `P(A and B)`, the probability **won't be the same** if one has already happened.


### Divide by B's probability

It shows how much the `A and B` covered the happened event `B`.

Solve:
- Based on the `conditional probability` formula: `P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)`
- The `P(south Asia ∣ high) = P(south Asia and High) / P(high) = 7/188 ÷ 87/188 = 7/87`
