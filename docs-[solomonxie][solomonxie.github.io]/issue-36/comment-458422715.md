# Makefile Is The New Python [DRAFT]

That is the point where I was intrigued the most to decide to learn `Makefile`.

Don't get it wrong,
the `Makefile` is NOT only for compiling the C/C++ programmes but to "anything".

Even if it's just a normal folder contains some _markdown_ files, you can create a `Makefile` to do some automation stuff to it.

In essence, a `Makefile` is just to run some _bash commands_ for you.
e.g., you want to do some `cp`, `rm` & `mv` in a folder, you can line them up in a `Makefile` and give it a simple name like `orgainize`, and run the command `make organize` to run all the commands you have defined, in which it looks like this:
```Makefile
# Makefile

organize:
    cp test.py test2.py
    rm *.pyc
    mv test.py test_bak.py
```
