## `胃溃疡` Stomach Ulcer
[Refer to youtube: How to Overcome Stomach Ulcers Fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2CWjksxo-E)

主要原因：`H-Pylori` 幽门螺杆菌
70% Stomach Ulcers are caused by `H-pylori` bacteria.

It's so **CRITICAL** that we increase the good bacteria and get rid of bad bacteria (h-pylori) in your body.

治疗方法:
- Remove these triggers:
    - No.1 causation issue: STOP eating large meals. Smaller meals frequently would be good.
    - Sugar will increase H-pylori
    - Caffeine makes it worse
    - Acidic food cause more pain
    - Reduce spicy food
    - Reduce processed food
