主要原因：`H-Pylori` 幽门螺杆菌
70% Stomach Ulcers are caused by `H-pylori` bacteria.
It's so **CRITICAL** that we increase the good bacteria and get rid of bad bacteria (h-pylori) in your body.

误解：
- ❌ Caused by stress
- ❌ Caused by food
- ❌ Caused by too much stomach acid

治疗方法:
- Remove these triggers:
    - **No.1 causation issue: STOP eating large meals. Smaller meals frequently would be good.**
    - **Sugar will INCREASE H-pylori**
    - Caffeine makes it worse
    - Acidic food cause more pain
    - Reduce spicy food
    - Reduce processed food
- Eat healing food:
    - No.1: Bone broth (骨头肉汤) for ANY type of Stomach Ulcer, which contains pH for soothing the pain, and `Proline`脯氨酸 & `Glutamine`谷氨酰胺 for healing the Stomach Lining (胃黏膜). Recommended drinking 2-3 times a day, with bit **chicken** and **cabbage**.
    - No.2 Cabbage Juice 洋白菜汁 contains a type of `Sulphur` 硫磺 that can heal the Gut Lining (肠内壁)
    - Aloe vera juice (芦荟汁): contains certain pH and `Polysaccharides` 多糖体 that can help to repair the ulcer.
    - Steamed vegetables: 
        - No.1: Carrot 胡萝卜
        - Asparagus 芦笋
