## What's the 「Inverse of a product」

Assume `A & B` are all invertible matrices, so what is `(AB)⁻¹`?

Yes, we multiply their inverses together `A⁻¹ & B⁻¹`, but in what order do we multiply these inverses?
**IN REVERSE ORDER.**
Which makes:
`(AB)(B⁻¹A⁻¹) = 𝐈` or `(B⁻¹A⁻¹)(AB) = 𝐈`. They perform in the same way get the same result.

so:

**`(AB)⁻¹ = (B⁻¹A⁻¹)`**


## Inverse of a 「Transposed Matrix」

So the Inverse of `(Aᵀ)⁻¹ = (A⁻¹)ᵀ`


## 「LU Decompose」 (without Row Exhcnage)

> "L is the product of Inverses."

**`L = E⁻¹`, which means L is the inverse of `elementary matrix`.**

Assume in the elimination process without row exchanges, we only apply `elementary matrices` to the matrix one by one.
So the `L` would be the **Inverse** of those elementary matrices, but in **Reverse order**.

```py
EA = U
A = LU
```

> So that steps above is the `Inverse Elementary Matrices` picture of getting the L. 
But actually what actually we get is really simple to observe:
**If no row exchanges, multipliers go directly into L.**

So as we've understood the meaning behind it, we can forget it and just remember the **`multipliers`**.


## Row exchanges with 「Permutations」

> For LU Decomposition, although we can't represent row exchanges with `Elementary Matrices`, but we can do it with `Permutation matrices`.

For a 3x3 Identity Matrix, there're 6 permutations of it:

**The `Inverse of a Permutation` is its `Transpose`**:
