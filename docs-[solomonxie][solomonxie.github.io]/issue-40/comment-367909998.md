## Notations

[`▶ Refer to Wiki: List of mathematical symbols`](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_mathematical_symbols)

- `Ɐ`: Reads as "Turned A", means "For all"
- `:=`or `=:`, reads as "is defined to be". "x := y, y =: x or x ≡ y" means x is defined to be another name for y, under certain assumptions taken in context.
- `⊗`: Tensor Product "V ⊗ W", reads as "tensor product of V and W"
- `∃`, reads as "Exists". "∃ x:P(x)" means "There exists _at least_ one x for P(x) is true".
- `∃!`, means "exists _exact_ one".
