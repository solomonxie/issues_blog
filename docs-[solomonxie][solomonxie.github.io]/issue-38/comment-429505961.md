# Notes on Coursera ML Andrew Ng

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.

> Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."


Supervised learning: "Right answers" given.
It can be a **Regression problem**, which `predict continuous valued output`,
also can be a **Classification** problem, which `predict discrete valued output`.
