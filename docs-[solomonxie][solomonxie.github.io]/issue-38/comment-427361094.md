The steps to building and using a model are:
- **Define:** What type of model will it be?  A decision tree?  Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
- **Fit:** Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.
- **Predict:** Just what it sounds like
- **Evaluate**: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.
