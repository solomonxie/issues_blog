# `Build Model for Machine Learning` (Simple)


## Steps of building a model

[Refer to Kaggle: Your First Machine Learning Model

The steps to building and using a model are:
- **Define:** What type of model will it be?  A decision tree?  Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
- **Fit:** Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.
- **Predict:** Just what it sounds like
- **Evaluate**: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.


## Underfitting and Overfitting

[Refer to Kaggle: Underfitting and Overfitting](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/underfitting-and-overfitting)

- Overfitting: The model matches the **training data** almost perfectly, but does poorly in predicting **new data**.
- Underfitting: The model fails to capture important patterns & distinctions in the data, so it performs poorly even in **training data**.
