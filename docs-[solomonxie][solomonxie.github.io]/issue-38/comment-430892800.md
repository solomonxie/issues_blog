## Model selection: `Prediction`  vs. `Inference`
- If our goal is to **understand** the data, namely the `inference`, then it's better to choose the model with more **interpretability**.
- if our goal is to **predict**, then it's good to go with models that have more **flexibility** but less understandable, sometime it may refer to "non-linear" models.

## Model selection: `Flexibility` vs. `Interpretability`

## `Clustering`
`Cluster Analysis` is NOT to compare `input and output(x & y)`, but to compare `two variables (x1 & x2)`,
because in the case there's no clear associate for `x & y`, we have left no choice but to analyze variables themselves.

## Model selection: `Quantitative` vs. `Qualitative`

- Numerical: Linear Regression
- Categorical: Logistic Regression, boosting, KNN


## Model selection: `Train MAE` vs. `Test MAE`

> In general, we do not really care how well the method works training on the `Training data`.
Rather, we are interested in the accuracy of the predictions that we obtain when we apply our method to previously `Unseen Test data`.

**We’d like to select the model for which the average of this quantity—the `test MSE`—is as small as possible.**

> There is no guarantee that the method with the lowest training MSE will also have the lowest test MSE.

> Regardless of whether overfitting has occurred, we almost always want the `Training MSE` to be SMALLER than the `Test MSE`, 
because most statistical learning methods either directly or indirectly seek to **minimize** the training MSE. Overfitting refers specifically to the case in which a less flexible model would have yielded a smaller test MSE.
