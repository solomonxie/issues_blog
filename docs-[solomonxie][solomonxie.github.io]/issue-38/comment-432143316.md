Gradient Descent is the process of **minimizing** a function by following the gradients of the cost function.

In Machine learning we can use a similar technique called `stochastic gradient descent` to minimize the error of a model on our training data.

Iteration:
The way this works is that each training instance is shown to the model one at a time. The model makes a prediction for a training instance, the error is calculated and the model is updated in order to reduce the error for the next prediction.

This procedure can be used **to find the set of coefficients** in a model that result in the smallest error for the model on the training data. 
Each iteration the coefficients, called `weights (w)` in machine learning language are updated using the equation:
```
w = w – alpha * delta
```
Where `w` is the **coefficient or weight** being optimized, 
`alpha` is a **learning rate** that you must configure (e.g. 0.1) and 
`gradient` is the error for the model on the training data attributed to the weight.
