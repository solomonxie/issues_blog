# `Stack` (Data structure)

## ADT DEFINITION

```py
ADT: <LINKED LIST>

DATA:
    - Node         # basic element, consists of two parts
        - value    # actual data
        - next     # pointer of the next node
    - LinkedList
        - length
        - head     # pointer of the head node

    The Linked list has nothing to do with array [1,2,3,4],
    but has of multiple nodes consist of two parts: value and pointer to the next node.
    That being said, 
    the object "LinkedList" has only two properties: length and a pointer to the head.
