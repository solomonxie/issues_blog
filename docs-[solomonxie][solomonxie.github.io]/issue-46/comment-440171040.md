A `tree` is a data structure composed of nodes It has the following characteristics:
- Each tree has a `root node` (at the top).
- The root node has zero or more `child nodes`.
- Each child node has zero or more child nodes, and so on.

A `binary search tree` adds these two characteristics:
- Each node has up to `two children`.
- For each node, its `left descendents` are less than the current node, which is less than the `right descendents`.
