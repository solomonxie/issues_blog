A tree is a data structure composed of nodes It has the following characteristics:
- Each tree has a root node (at the top).
- The root node has zero or more child nodes.
- Each child node has zero or more child nodes, and so on.

A binary search tree adds these two characteristics:
- Each node has up to two children.
- For each node, its left descendents are less than the current node, which is less than the right descendents.
