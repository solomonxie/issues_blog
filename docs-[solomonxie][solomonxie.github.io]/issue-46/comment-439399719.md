# `ADT` (Abstract Data Type)

> "ADT may be defined as a "class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations"

`ADT` is actually the `pseudo code` of the implementation of data structures.

> `ADT` is the gate to understand all Data structures. Because having all the `behaviors` of an data type in mind, helps a lot to understand what actually the data type is and does.

## ADT of List

```py
ADT: <LIST>

DATA:
    - It is an array of values with basic data types;
    - All values stored in the memory are next to each other.

OPERATIONS:
    init(size):
        create memory space for a size for the list.
    isEmpty():
        return True if the list is empty.
    clear():
        clear out the list.
    getElement(index):
        return the value positioned at index.
    locateElement(value):
        return the index for the value.
    insertElement(value, index):
        insert the value at a certain index.
    deleteElement(index):
        delete the element at a certain index.
    getLength():
        return the length of the list.
