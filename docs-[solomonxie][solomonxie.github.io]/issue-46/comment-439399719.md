# `ADT` (Abstract Data Type)

> "ADT may be defined as a "class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations"

`ADT` is actually the `pseudo code` of the implementation of data structures.

> `ADT` is the gate to understand all Data structures. Because having all the `behaviors` of an data type in mind, helps a lot to understand what actually the data type is and does.
