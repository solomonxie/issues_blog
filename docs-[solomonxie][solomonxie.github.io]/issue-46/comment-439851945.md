# `Linked List` (Data structure)

## ADT DEFINITION

```py
ADT: <LINKED LIST>

DATA:
    - Node         # basic element, consists of two parts
        - value    # actual data
        - next     # pointer of the next node
    - LinkedList
        - length
        - head     # pointer of the head node

    The Linked list has nothing to do with array [1,2,3,4],
    but has of multiple nodes consist of two parts: value and pointer to the next node.
    That being said, 
    the object "LinkedList" has only two properties: length and a pointer to the head.

OPERATIONS:
    peekHead():
        return the position of the head node

    size():
        return the length of list.

    add(value):
        (*) set a new node as the head, and point to the previous head.

    addAt(index):
        insert a node at the index, 

    remove(value):
        (*) delete the head node, and set the previous second node as head.

    removeAt(index):
        delete a node at the index, 

    indexOf(value):
        (*) return the index of a node if the values are the same. The search starts from head.

    elementAt(index):
        (*) return the value of a node at the index. There's a search starts from head.

    isEmpty():
        return True if the length is 0.
