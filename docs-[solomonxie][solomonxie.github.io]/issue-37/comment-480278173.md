# What is Continuous Integration? [DRAFT]

> It's all about **TESTING**, and applied in the scenario of **DAILY MULTIPLE MERGES TO MASTER BRANCH**.

Start from the beginning, as the team's `branching strategy`, what we do is to **develop all feature or fix** at a `feature branch` out of the master branch.
When the development is finished, we run the unit tests and functional tests at the feature branch by a simple command like `pytest /path/to/project/tests` to make sure all tests are passed.
Then seems it's ready to merged to master branch.
What does it mean by `merge to master`? It means that the code is ready to RELEASE to the public, to show to the customers, which is critical and can be risky. We want it to be as less risky as possible.
