# Q: Can a Christian lose salvation

## Short answer
No. A Christian can not lose salvation.
But, the problem is that Are you a real Christian?
“By their fruit you will recognize them” (Matthew 7:16).

And another problem is that, even if you can't lose salvation, but God will destroy you in your current life as a consequence to your sin.
