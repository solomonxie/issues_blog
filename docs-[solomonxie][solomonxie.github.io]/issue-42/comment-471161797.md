# Swagger [DRAFT]

## What is Swagger

Swagger is a API Definition Language. Yeah, you heard it right, it's a **language**, or more specifically it's the **implementation** of that API Definition Language, which the language itself actually is called the `OpenAPI`.

`OpenAPI` is a _protocol_ generally recognized that more and more organizations in the world apply it in their API architecture just like`REST` or `OAuth`.
As an open-source community driven framework, `Swagger` becomes the most common implementation of that protocol OpenAPI, just like Django-Rest to REST protocol.

In the framework, Swagger provides a bunch of tools for us to generate APIs by simply defining a yaml file:
- Swagger Codegen
- Swagger Editor
- Swagger UI

We write a `swagger.yaml`, and the java based tool `swagger-codegen` will generate a whole API _Server Code Base_ & _API client_ for us in multiple language: Python, Ruby, Rust and such.

## How to build API with Swagger Tools

> "The Best APIs are Built with Swagger Tools." - The banner of Swagger official site _swagger.io_

To build API for our product, we need to go through these stages: `Design`, `Build`, `Documentation`, `Test` and `Standardize`. And Swagger provides tools for all the stages above.
