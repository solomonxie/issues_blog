# Swagger [DRAFT]

## What is Swagger

Swagger is a API Definition Language. Yeah, you heard it right, it's a **language**, or more specifically it's the **implementation** of that API Definition Language, which the language itself actually is called the `OpenAPI`.

`OpenAPI` is a _protocol_ generally recognized that more and more organizations in the world apply it in their API architecture just like`REST` or `OAuth`.
As an open-source community driven framework, `Swagger` becomes the most common implementation of that protocol OpenAPI, just like Django-Rest to REST protocol.

In the framework, Swagger provides a bunch of tools for us to generate APIs by simply defining a yaml file:
- Swagger Codegen
- Swagger Editor
- Swagger UI

We write a `swagger.yaml`, and the java based tool `swagger-codegen` will generate a whole API _Server Code Base_ & _API client_ for us in multiple language: Python, Ruby, Rust and such.

## How to build API with Swagger Tools

> "The Best APIs are Built with Swagger Tools." - The banner of Swagger official site _swagger.io_

To build API for our product, we need to go through these stages: `Design`, `Build`, `Documentation`, `Test` and `Standardize`. And Swagger provides tools for all the stages above.

Let's go through how Swagger will help with those stages:
- `Design`: The online `Swagger Editor` is really convenient for composing `swagger.yaml` which shows you in real-time the API and syntax errors by the time you type.
- `Build`: Once you got the well defined `swagger.yaml`, `swagger-codegen` will generate a whole `server code base`, say in Python, for you merely based on the API definition you just write. And with no extra effor you can then open a browser and visit the APIs (but before you implement each API's response, that'll be an empty page with `200 OK.` response code.
- `Documentation`: The first common use of Swagger is to generate a whole explicit document for your API structure with ease. This saves days or weeks of efforts of engineers.
- `Test`
- `Standardize`


## Swagger Syntax

By far you've probably got some basic about what is Swagger and what tools it provides, and you got the idea that building API might only need you to write a simple text file called `swagger.yaml`.
Before composing definitions in that file, we'd like to know some basic syntax.

And before you start, you might want to do the composing on [Swagger Editor (Online)](https://editor.swagger.io/) which gives you the instant result on your API definitions in a clear visual mode and shows you all suggestions or syntax errors if they exist.

- `tags` regards to `filename`
- `operationId` regards to `function name`
