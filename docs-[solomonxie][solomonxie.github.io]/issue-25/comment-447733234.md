# VIM内置文件浏览框NetRW

g:netrw_browse_split是重要的选项，直接影响体验：
```vim
 *g:netrw_browse_split*    when browsing, <cr> will open the file by:
                =0: re-using the same window  (default)
                =1: horizontally splitting the window first
                =2: vertically   splitting the window first
                =3: open file in new tab
                =4: act like "P" (ie. open previous window)
```
