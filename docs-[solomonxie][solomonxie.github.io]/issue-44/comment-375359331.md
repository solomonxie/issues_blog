> Mind that, `y = (1/3)^(x)` is **EQUAL** to `y = 3^(-x)`.

> `y = (1/3)^x`, **FRACTION BASE (less than 1)**

Notice that:
You should first to choose a `asymptote`, horizontal or vertical. Then plot two points to finish.

-----------------------

Strategy: 
> Have a image in mind, how it flips up & down, left & right, picture the final image. Then plot.

First:
>  We need to look at the BASE `1/3`. It's lot more intuitive to convert the **FRACTION** into an INTEGER, or a fraction larger than 1. Just make it to `3^(-x-1)`. Makes lots more sense.

Then:
> Look at the EXPONENT, `(-x-1)`, according to the `FUNCTIONS' TRANSFORMATION`, it seems to move graph to the ~right~ by 1 unit, but wrong! 

It should be a WHOLE: `-(x+1)`, so it is move **LEFT** by 1 unit, **AND THEN** flip around **HORIZONTALLY**.
When it flips horizontally, it initially flips about `y-axis`, but since it was moved left by 1 unit, it then flips about the `x = -1`.

Then: 
> Look at the FACTOR, `-2(...) +7`. It should **FIRST** to **FLIP** vertically, **AND THEN** move up 7 units.
