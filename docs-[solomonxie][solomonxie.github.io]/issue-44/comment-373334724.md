# `Arithmetic Sequences`

[Refer to khan academy: `Arithmetic Sequences`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/sequences/constructing-arithmetic-sequences/a/arithmetic-sequences-review)

In `arithmetic sequences`, there's a `common difference`, 
which means the difference between neighbour terms **is always the same**.

We can represent the sequence as a `formula`.
In the formula, we set the 1st term as `k`, and `common difference` as `d`.
There're two forms of formula to represent the sequence:
- [`Explicit form`: ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/sequences/constructing-arithmetic-sequences/a/writing-explicit-formulas-for-arithmetic-sequences)

- [`Recursive form`:](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/sequences/constructing-arithmetic-sequences/a/writing-recursive-formulas-for-arithmetic-sequences)

## `Geometric sequences`

[Refer to khan academy: `Geometric sequences`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/sequences/constructing-geometric-sequences/a/geometric-sequences-review)

Similar idea for `arithmetic sequences`, only it's multiplying a `common ratio` here for `geometric sequences`, instead of adding a common difference in arithmetic sequences.

The `common ratio` below is 2:

There're also two forms for geometric sequences' formula:

- `Explicit form`:

- `Recursive form`:
