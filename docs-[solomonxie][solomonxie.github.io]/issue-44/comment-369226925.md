```

> "One **`half`**"
"One **over** two"
```py
1/2
```

> "Three **`halves`**"
"Three **over** two".
```py
3/2
```

> "x plus one **`over`** x minus one" .
```py
(x+1)/(x-1)
```


## [`exponent`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/cc-6th-arithmetic-operations/cc-6th-exponents/v/introduction-to-exponents)

> "x **`squared`**"
"x (**raised**) **`to the`** **`second`** (**`power`**)"
```py
x²
```

> "x **`cubed`**"
"x **`to the`** **`third`** (**`power`**)"
```py
x³
```
> "Three to the **`zeroth`** power"
```py
3⁰
```

> "Nine **`to the`** a plus b (**`power`**)."
```py
9⁽ª⁺ᵇ⁾
```
> "Five **`to the`** three t (power)."
```py
5³ᵗ
```


## `Factorial !`
> "4 factorial"
"4 shriek"
"4 bang"
```py
4!
```

## `composite function`

> "f **`of`** x."
```py
f(x)
```

> "g **`of`** f **`of`** x."
```py
(g◦f)(x)
```

> "h **`of`** g **`of`** minus six".
```py
(f◦g)(-6)
```


## `Set`

> "x belongs to B", or "x is an element of B"
```py
x ∈ B
```

> "y does not belong to B"
```py
y ∉ B
```


## `Subset`

> "A is a subset of B", or "A is contained in B"
```py
A ⊇ B
```


> "B is a superset of A", or "B includes A", or "B contains A"
```py
B ⊇ A
```
The relationship between sets established by ⊆ is called inclusion or containment.
