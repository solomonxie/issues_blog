# `Equivalent` systems of equations

The word `equivalent` here for system of equation, means **both systems have the same solution**.
Equations in two systems, don't have to be the same thing at all. **If you draw a line for each equation, there could be very different lines for each one.**

Let's say it's in 2D, that term here literarily means two systems of 4 lines end up crossing at the same point (x,y), aka the solution.

## How to determine if two systems are equivalent

You could either solve the solution for each system then compare the solution, or just to compare each equation with the counterpart(only in a easy case).

### Solving method: `Elimination`

Ordinary way at middle school level: to eliminate variables and solve each variable one by one.

### Solving method: Compare equations
