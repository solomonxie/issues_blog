Special Limits\r\n\r\n## `Limits at infinity of quotients with trig`\r\nCalculating limits related to a trig function, is necessary to use the **`Squeeze theorem`**.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40047015-e86fb63a-5860-11e8-9f72-b97d62f785c2.png)\r\nSolve:\r\n- Know that `-1 ≦ cos(x) ≦ 1`, so we can tweak it to apply the `squeeze theorem` to get its limit.\r\n- Make the inequality to: `3/-1 ≦ 3/cos(x)/-1 ≦ 3/1`\r\n- Get that right side `3/-1 = -1` and left side `3/1 =1` is not equal.\r\n- So the limit doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n**Easier solution steps**:\r\n- Know the inequality `-1 ≦ cos(x) ≦ 1`\r\n- Replace `cos(x)` to ` ±1` in the equation, `3/±1`.\r\n- Calculate limits of two sides.\r\n- If the results are exactly the same, then the limit is the result; Otherwise the limit doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40047463-2181c778-5862-11e8-8658-d439cdcecf65.png)\r\nSolve:\r\n- Know that `-1 ≦ sin(x) ≦ 1`\r\n- Replace `sin(x)` as `±1`\r\n- Left side becomes `(5x+1)/(x-5)`, right side becomes `(5x-1)/(x-5)`\r\n- Both sides' limits are `5`, so the limit exists, and is `5`."}]
