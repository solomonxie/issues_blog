Derivative, is the `Instantaneous Rate of Change`, which's related to the `tangent line` of a point, instead of a secant line to calculate the Average rate of change.\r\n\r\n“Derivatives are the

`Lagrange's notation`\r\nIn Lagrange's notation, the derivative of `f(x)` expressed as `f'(x)`, reads as `f prime of x`.\r\n\r\n### `Leibniz's notation`\r\nIn this form, we write `dx` instead of `Δx heads towards 0`.\r\nAnd `the derivative of` is commonly written as: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40105095-9470659c-5924-11e8-8e8d-8916bef4c995.png)\r\n\r\n> For memorizing, just see `d` as `Δ`, reads `Delta`, means change. So `dy/dx` means `Δy/Δx`. Or it can be represent as `df / dx` or `d/dx · f(x)`, whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40105113-9d98cdd0-5924-11e8-86a2-e918c0109b23.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40102277-a5ba5b26-591c-11e8-9d8f-ecdb59db5b69.png)\r\n\r\n## `Tangent line & Secant line`\r\n\r\n- The `secant line` is drawn to connect TWO POINTS, and gets us the `Average Rate of Change` between two points.\r\n- The `Tangent line` is drawn through ONE POINT, and gets us the `Rage of change at the exact moment`.\r\n\r\nAs for the `secant line`, its interval gets smaller and smaller and APPROACHING to `0` distance, it actually is a process of calculating `limits` approaching `0`, which will get us the `tangent line`, that been said, is the whole business we're talking about: the `Derivative`, the `Instantaneous Rate of Change`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40102814-125b24e4-591e-11e8-9d6d-f51e0fc85ee6.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40102982-8c9e92c2-591e-11e8-9893-6f4d4c7fc876.png)\r\n\r\n![secant

`Derivative equation`\r\nThe idea of derivative equation is quite simple: **The LIMIT of the SLOPE.**\r\n\r\n> The slope is equal to `change in Y / change in X`. \r\nSo for a point `a`, we IMAGINE we have another near point which lies on the SAME LINE with `a`, \r\nand since we have TWO POINTS now, \r\nwe can then let their `Y-value Change` divided by their `X-value Change` to get the slope.\r\n\r\nThere're two equations for calculating derivative at a point, and the only different thing is how to express the IMAGINARY POINT with respect to the point `a`, it could either be `x` or `a+h`

`How to calculate derivative`\r\nStrategy:\r\n- Determine if it's **CONTINUOUS** at this point, by:\r\n    - See if the point is defined in the interval\r\n    - Calculate **LIMITS** of both RIGHT SIDE and LEFT SIDE of the point.\r\n    - If two sides' limits are the same, then it's continuous. Otherwise it's discontinuous.\r\n- Determine if it's **DIFFERENTIABLE** (Actually is the process of getting its **derivative**):\r\n    - Apply Derivative equation to get both RIGHT SIDE LIMIT and LEFT SIDE LIMIT.\r\n    - If two sides' limits are the same, then that value is the **Derivative** at the point. If not, then it's NOT DIFFERENTIABLE.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40156524-990fb1fe-59cc-11e8-939c-104e910309ab.png)\r\nSolve:\r\n- See that the point `3` is defined in the interval.\r\n- Left side limit of the point, is using the first equation, and gets the `lim g(x) = -7`\r\n- Right side limit of the point, is using the second equation, and gets the `lim g(x) = -7`\r\n- Limits of both sides are the SAME, so it's continuous, and let's see if it's differentiable.\r\n- Apply the derivative equation for both Left side  & Right side:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40156768-197072c4-59ce-11e8-9a2f-d9e09cd354c7.png)\r\n- Both sides' limits exists but not that same, so it's not

the interval.\r\n- Left side limit of the point, is using the first equation, and gets the `lim g(x) = 1`\r\n- Right side limit of the point, is using the second equation, and gets the `lim g(x) = 4`\r\n- Limits of both sides are NOT SAME, so it's not continuous, then of course not
