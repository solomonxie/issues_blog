By having a wild thought on start a career on Artificial intelligence, started today to do a tiny research on how to study AI. It turns out it consist of a shit black hole of knowledges, which means I have to study all of those things, not mention even some basic terms are causing a headache to me, such like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Mining, Big Data, Classification etc etc. Thus I tend to write down some notes and random thoughts here helping me to organise it better. Saying, a tiny pen is better than a great brain.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n### Math\r\n\r\n- [x] Linear Algebra (Finished Basics)\r\nPCA, SVD, Eigen Decomposition, LU Decomposition, QR Decomposition, Norms, Projection, Symmetric Matrix, Orthogonal Matrix, Matrix Operations, Vector Space, \r\n- [ ] Differential Calculus\r\n- [ ] Integral Calculus\r\n- [ ] Multivariable

Python中文字符的理解：str()、repr()、print\n\n都说Python人不把文字编码这块从头到尾、从古至今全研究通透的话是完全玩不转的。我终于深刻的理解到了。通宵了好几夜，各种试验，print、print再print，中文还是既得不到也输不出。\n看了网上几乎所有主要的相关文章，还是没搞定。沉静下来开始反思：是他们写的不好，还是我理解的不好？所以我决定，再加深程度，一步一个脚印地研究这个问题，不忽略任何一个小细节的理解。先从字符串在Python中最基本的原理理解起。\n首先说明一下，我的开发环境是：\n\n```\npython --version : 2.7\nOS: Windows 7 (32bit)\nIDE: Sublime3, IDLE, Windows cmd命令行\n```\n## Python 字符串的存储\n\n先看一段代码，这是在IDLE命令行中几个简单的交互：\n\n``` python\n    >>> 'hello'\n    'hello'\n    >>> print 'hello'\n    hello\n    >>> '你好'\n    '\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'\n    >>> print '你好'\n    你好\n```\n\n`(都知道在python的命令行里，直接输入一个变量会显示它的值，直接输入一个复杂对象会给你显示它的对象类型和内存地址)`\n从上面可以看出，变量时英文的话不管直接输入还是print结果都一样。可是为什么`直接输入变量`和`print变量`会显示不一样的东西呢？\n原来，python 2系是绝对`英文友好`的。中文对于它来说，**只存储为一串编码而不是原文**。\n`\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3`这种东西对于中国python人来说是再熟悉不过的东西了，没事就蹦出来几次。最逗的是，我查了半天，`\\x$$`这种东西到底是什么编码，是utf-8还是gb2312？竟然没找到什么明确的说法，这个一会儿再说了。\n### 话说回来，为什么`'你好'`和`print '你好'`结果会不一样呢？\n\n在查看`print`官方文档时发现，在python里面print是一个非常厉害的小家伙：它能把几乎任何常见类型的对象打印成一串文字，甚至包括列表、字典、元组等等。这在别的语言里是不可理解的，所以给从其他语言转过来的人埋了个大坑。\n### 总结：Python中出现的任何中文，虽然我们在编辑器里看到的是中文，但是背地里全是一串编码。千万不要轻易信任print！`print xx`给你显示出来的，其实并不是xx的真实面貌！\n\n至于这个编码是什么格式，unicode还是utf-8之类，一会再说。\n## Python中的`str()`和`repr()`原生函数\n\n好多人都知道str()能把123数字转成字符串，python里的str()甚至还能把列表、字典等对象转成字符串。这都好理解，可是一旦把`str()`和`repr()`放在一起，大家就全都不淡定了-_-!\n来看一段代码，仍是在IDLE里交互：\n\n``` python\n    >>> str('hello')\n    'hello'\n    >>> repr('hello')\n    \"'hello'\"\n\n    >>> str('你好')\n    '\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'\n    >>> repr('你好')\n    \"'\\\\xc4\\\\xe3\\\\xba\\\\xc3'\"\n```\n\n先看前两句：英文的'hello'在str()后仍是'hello'，可是在repr()后就变成了\"'hello'\"。这就说明，str()返回的就是字符串本身，而repr()虽然返回的也是字符串，但它是一个`标准字符串`，官方解释比较绕，我来解释下吧。`repr`是representation及描述的意思，不是对人的描述，而是对python机器的描述，也就是它会将某物返回一个它`在python中的描述`。说人话：`repr(obj)`告诉我们obj这个变量在背地里是什么样子，在背地里是怎么被python处理被python\"玩弄\"的。\n**在python里，我们总会被眼睛欺骗。编辑器里显示的东西，并不总是它原本的面貌。python为了方便，总是表面上一套，背地里又一套。**\n再来理解后两句：中文的'你好'在str()后变成了编码'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'，在repr()后变成了\"'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'\"。`\\`都加上了转移符变成`\\\\`，相当于把字符串中的内容都“标准化”了。至于`'`变成`\"`只是为了说明repr()返回的是一个经过处理的新字符串。\n## print后的str()和repr()\n\n来看代码：\n\n```\n    >>> print str('你好')\n    你好\n    >>> print repr('你好')\n    '\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'\n```\n\n之前str('你好')显示的是`'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'`，而一经过print，就变成了正确的'你好'。上面说过了，命令行里直接输入一个变量，显示的是它在python后台存储的数据；而用print出来的东西，会显出出尽量友好、让人能看懂的东西。\n理解了这个，对print这两个结果的不同，也就全然理解了。然后也就放弃print作为考据的心了。\n\n_另外，以上代码的交互，再windows系统cmd中，结果是一样的。_\n### 这样一来，python对字符串的基本理解就差不多了。这篇文章里尽量避免了对各种code编码的讨论，如unicode, ascii, ANSI, UTF-8, GB2312, GBK等等，是因为太复杂了。简单东西先理解，把基础先打牢，复杂的东西下一篇再研究。\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/9","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/9/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/9/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/9/events","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/9","id":120883295,"number":9,"title":"对Python

总之对于这个我唯一认定的事就是：Python里要是弄不明白编码，那这个语言就放弃吧！\n\n下面是目前收获到的一些内容，没写完，再议吧。。。\n\n首先要在文件第一行写上`编码声明`\n\n```\n#coding:utf-8\n```\n\n编码声明的格式其实很随意的，coding=utf-8, -_\\- Coding:Utf-8 -_\\- 等等都行，  \nPython只识别关键的字。  \n如果不写编码声明，那么文件中出现的任何中文都会报错：  \n`SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\\xe5' in file xx.py on line 2, \n    but no encoding declared; see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details`\n\nPython 2.x 系列对中文真是弱爆了，查了巨多的文献，还是不那么明了。  \n本来想要练习开发个什么小程序，结果全都被扼杀在编码的坑里了。  \n随便搜一搜\"Python 编码\"就知道，所有作者们都遇到了一毛一样的问题。。。  \n据说，\n\n```\n除非把整个编码系统从古至今的历史熟透，各编码的原理通透，\n相互之间的转换了熟于胸，Python的这个坑是跨不过去的。小看了这小玩意儿！  \n```\n\n下面开始正式研究下吧，争取能做到practical。\n\n这是原始汉字数据：\n\n```\nchinese = '你好' # 普通中文字符串\nuni = u'你好' # 字符串前加u代表转换为unicode变量类型\n```\n# 研究一个原始的中文字符串\n\n在IDLE命令行中执行一下试试\n\n```\n>>> chinese\n'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'\n>>> print chinese\n你好\n>>> type(chinese)\n<type 'str'>\n```\n\n这是什么鬼！为什么直接输变量名和打印变量名会不一样呢？！\n静悄悄的理解一下，应该是：\nchinese变量在内存中存储的就是`\\xc4`这种编码，是给机器看的\n而print打印出来的是给人看的，所以python要处理一下让人能看懂。\n再来说，`\\xc4`这是个什么码？而且`你好`是两个字，为什么编码里有4个`\\x$$`这种？\n所以推理到，python对每个汉字是用2个编码来存储的。\n首先能确定的是，`\\x$$`这种格式是ASCII编码，因为百科到如下：\n\n> ASCII(American Standard Code forInformation Interchange)，是一种单字节的编码。计算机世界里一开始只有英文，而单字节可以表示256个不同的字符，可以表示所有的英文字符和许多的控制符号。不过ASCII只用到了其中的一半（\\x80以下）\n\n也就是说，英文字母用`\\x01`到`\\x80`之间的数表示，数字不用编码，\n那么汉字这种国外字就全部都是从`\\x80`往后排了。因为字太多，肯定不够用，所以:\n1. 格式变成了'\\x字母数字'这种东西\n2. 而且还用两个字节码来表示一个中国汉字。\n## 用chardet检测字符串编码\n\n那么来检验一下我的推理吧？用个第三方模块`chardet`  \n\n``` python\nimport chardet\nprint chardet.detect('你好')\n# [结果]: {'confidence': 0.3598212120361634, 'encoding': 'TIS-620'}\n```\n\n这什么鬼！！为什么检测出来有35%的`TIS-620编码`？\n不能放弃，我再来试一试：\n\n``` python\nimport chardet\nprint chardet.detect(str('你好'))\n# [结果]: {'confidence': 0.3598212120361634, 'encoding': 'TIS-620'}\nprint chardet.detect(repr('你好'))\n# [结果]: {'confidence': 1.0, 'encoding': 'ascii'}\n```\n\n真是受够了。。。\n为什么检测`str()`出来的就是`TIS-620`，而检测`repr()`出来的就是`ASCII`呢？\nPython世界中，str和repr到底谁才更接近本源、谁才是出来捣乱的呢？\n唉算了吧，不用这个了。\n## str 和 repr 在存储和print打印上的对比\n\n我又想起了一个实验，我们再来一下：\n\n```\n>>> repr('你好')\n\"'\\\\xc4\\\\xe3\\\\xba\\\\xc3'\"\n>>> print repr('你好')\n'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'\n>>> str('你好')\n'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'\n>>> print str('你好')\n你好\n```\n\n什么毛病！据说`repr()`和`str()`是一样的啊！怎么会这样呢？\n实验里，`repr()`和`str()`的内存数据的确是一样的，但是一print就不一样了：\n只有print `str()`才会显示出中文！\n那可能是print的问题了。那是不是说如果我不print，而是别的操作如存到文件中，那么就不会有中文出现了？试试吧：\n\n``` python\nf = open('test.txt', 'w')\nf.write(str('你好'))\nf.write(repr('你好'))\n# [结果]：你好 '\\xe4\\xbd\\xa0\\xe5\\xa5\\xbd'\n```\n\n也就是说不是print的问题了，`str()`和`repr()`在本质上就是有区别的。\n只有`str()`会把中文显示出来，而`repr()`不但会把中文显示成`ASCII码`，\n还会异常搞笑的把在print里显示4位字节码变成6位字节码！！！这是什么毛病？！\n好吧，这个先留着，来看看转成了unicode的中文吧。\n# 研究已变成unicode类型的中文字符串\n\n好吧，再来试一试uni：\n\n```\n>>> uni\nu'\\u4f60\\u597d'\n>>> print uni\n你好\n>>> type(uni)\n<type 'unicode'>\n```\n\n这又是什么鬼！我原先的想象是，\nprint一个unicode对象，肯定出来的是unicode码，但两种方法的结果完全反了。。。\n再静悄悄的理解下，uni肯定也是在内存中存储的是unicode编码。\n在python中unicode的格式是：u'\\u$$$$'，其中$$$$代表4位的字符编码。\n然后又试了一下这个：\n## str(unicode类型) 和 repr(unicode类型) 结果的对比\n\n```\n>>> str(uni)\n.......\nUnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 0-1 ......\n>>> repr(uni)\n\"u'\\\\u4f60\\\\u597d'\"\n```\n## str()和repr()的对比\n\n这个好理解，用`help(str)`命令可以看到：\nstr(`basestring`)是将某个object变成一个漂亮的易观看的字符串。\n并且，它需要的是basestring类型变量作为参数。\n而`help(repr)`只是简单说，repr(`object`)会返回这个object的规范化字符串。\n它对参数并没有什么要求。\n这样对比来看的话，str和repr在**in**和**out**上都不一样。\nstr 对谁进来有限定，出去要漂亮要好看；\nrepr对谁进来无所谓，出去也够标准就行。\n# 原始中文字符串和unicode格式的中文字符串对比\n\n暂时写不下去了，再议吧。。。。。。。。\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/8","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/8/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/8/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/8/events","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/8","id":120586965,"number":8,"title":"Python
