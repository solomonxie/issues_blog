It must be different from other days. Should we consider one day is holy than another?\r\n\r\n### Gen 2:5\r\n> Time theory\r\nNo plants had yet sprung up because no rain. \r\nThere’s the idea against `Evolution`: \r\nIt seems **time was frozen** for the plants, can’t die or grow. \r\nTime was not moving until the rain drop down.\r\nWe could apply the same way about time to: stars, lights, living creatures. \r\n\r\n### Gen 2:7\r\n> `The breath of life`.\r\nQ: What’s so special about that breath, why does it have to be breath than other way?\r\n\r\n### Gen 2:8\r\n> God created man first, **AFTER** it created the garden.\r\n\r\n> Garden is in the `east`. So it’s not always bad in the bible about the east.\r\n(In the bible, when God punish someone, He often let him go east.)\r\n\r\n### Gen 2:9\r\n> God made trees in garden that either **pleasant to sight** or **good for food**, \r\nQ: so which one that `tree of life` and `tree of knowledge` belong to ?\r\nTOL good for sight, or TOK good for food?\r\n\r\n- Gen 3:6 answered: TOK is both good for food and sight, and brings cleverness .\r\n\r\n> `Tree of knowledge of good and evil`\r\nQ: Does it mean it only has the knowledge about good and evil, not all knowledge?\r\n\r\n### Gen 2:15\r\n> God let man to be steward in the garden to take care of it, like an assistant. \r\nDoesn't it depict the `original relationship` designed between God and man . \r\n\r\n### Gen 2:17\r\n> God knows what will happen that man will sin but still warn him. \r\nWhat was God thinking then?\r\nI could say , **knowing what will happen is not the reason for what He should do**.\r\nAnd God must not be trapped by the `time theory` or `butterfly effect`, \r\nnor force Himself to make the future happen. \r\nIt could be the best way to do so among all other way, \r\nor even it could be His favourite way among all other ways.\r\nTo think about this question, must have a strong intuition about time theory or related idea. \r\nCouldn’t just say that: why should God put tree of knowledge here at first place.\r\n\r\n### Gen 2:18\r\n> God wants Adam to have a helper, \r\nnotice that: here God did not just made Eva all of sudden, \r\nbut led all living creatures to Adam and let him choose.\r\nBut he didn’t choose anyone as a helper, \r\nafter all that, God made the idea to make a woman for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Gen 2:21\r\n> God causes a `deep sleep` upon man and took out his rib:\r\n`World’s first surgery`, with strong `anaesthetic`. \r\nNot \"sleep\" but \"deep sleep\", so he could t feel pain.\r\n\r\n### Gen 2:22\r\n> Sounds like `gene clone project`: \r\ntake a part of human and make a copy , with altered DNA.\r\nCan’t say God is not `the first and the best doctor and biologist`.\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/comments/372922941","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/45#issuecomment-372922941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/45","id":372922941,"user":{"login":"solomonxie","id":14041622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14041622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-14T06:57:07Z","updated_at":"2018-03-16T03:39:36Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"# `The First Man's fall` Genesis 3\r\nGenesis three is the start of `Human's Fall`.\r\n\r\n### Gen 3:1\r\n> \"Now\" the serpent...\r\nQ: `Now` emphasise the time moving or the nature of a living creature’s changing? \r\n\r\n> It’s more crafty than any other beast: \r\nQ: what’s the definition of `crafty` here? \r\nIs it sin, is it impurity or heart of hurting others ? \r\nOr it’s simply just a way to say cleverness?\r\n\r\n> Q: Why didn’t the serpent **speak to man first**? \r\nQ: What would happen if it spoke to man first. \r\nQ: Did it ever talk to the man at all ?\r\n\r\n### Gen 3:3\r\n> Eva was citing God’s command and also add something new to it, which was coming from nowhere. \r\nThat’s a very interesting thing to dig in. \r\nwhat would you say what was happening there referring to Eva's action? \r\n`Gossip`, is the original fault Eve made.\r\nCould you say it's all serpent's fault?\r\nAdding things to God's first rule, it was **the first mistake** mentioned in the Bible.\r\nDid the serpent did something wrong?

Only thing I can guess of is that God just set a visible warning for human not to do stupid things to come, so that human won’t be hurt. \r\nSo it’s because God love man, that’s why He set up the visible sign to keep them away. \r\n\r\n> Q: And again what’s meaning of maintaining the tree? \r\nAll I can think of is that one day we will return ? \r\nWhere is this garden?
