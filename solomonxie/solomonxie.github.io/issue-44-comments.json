In `vector` related problems, it's also called the `direction angle`, see [this Khan practice](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/e/direction-angles).\r\n\r\nThe side opposite to that angle is called `Opposite`.\r\nThe side next to the angle is called `Adjacent`, \"A-Jason-t\".\r\nThe side is long is called `Hypotenuse`, \"High-po-ten-news`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36719484-1f16b318-1be0-11e8-9038-4e4f9da05fe2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to calculate sine, cosine and tangent of an angle \r\nREMEMBER SHORTCUT: `SOH-CAH-TOA`, pronounced \"so-kah-tow-ah\".\r\n- `S`in = `O`pposite / `H`ypotenuse \r\n- `C`on = `A`djacent / `H`ypotenuse\r\n- `T`an = `O`pposite / `A`djacent\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36720552-5e5182ee-1be3-11e8-92d1-33e1f0218ee8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to calculate the ratio of an angle?\r\nWe want to know what the ratio of an angle is, 60° or 59°?\r\nIf we know `tan(x) = 123`, whatever, then we can get it by `x = tan_inverse(123)`.\r\n`tan_inverse(...)` or `tan⁻¹(...)` are the same.\r\n\r\n## How to calculate the ratio of an `direction angle`\r\n> `direction angle` is a term for vectors. It is the angle we care about for a vector, which is in between of the vector line and the positive side of axis-x.\r\n\r\n**The ratio of a `direction angle` is always drawn from the positive side of axis-x, so that you could know what direction is this vector going to.**\r\n\r\nFor a vector we only know its x-distance and y-distance, so in terms of trigonometry, or in `right triangle`, they're `Opposite` and `Adjacent`.  So that we could use `Tangent` to calculate the ratio, such as `tan⁻¹(y/x)`.\r\n\r\n**But the thing is**, `tan⁻¹(...)` always gives you a number less then 90. So we have to do some tricks for doing this when the direction angle's ratio of a vector is greater than 90, or lesser 0.\r\n\r\nTo classify those situations, we use the idea of `4 quadrant` of the axis system.\r\n\r\n> And once we see x and y, we could immediately identify which quadrant the vector will fall into, then use the different method to calculte as follow:\r\n\r\n### [1st Quadrant ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (+x, +y):\r\n```\r\nRatio =

In geometry, a translation moves a thing up and down or left and right.\r\n- [`Rotation`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-transformations-intro/a/intro-to-rotations): Turn or rotate the shape. In geometry, rotations make things turn in a cycle around a definite center point. \r\n- [`Reflection`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence/basic-geo-reflections/a/reflecting-shapes): Flip or mirror the shape. A reflection is a transformation that acts like a mirror: It swaps all pairs of points that are on exactly opposite sides of the line of reflection.\r\n- [`Dilation`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence/basic-geo-dilations/v/dilating-from-an-arbitrary-point-example): Expand or shrink the shape.\r\n\r\nAnd,\r\nyou can group above types of transformations into two groups: `Rigid transformations` and `Dilations`\r\n\r\n## [`Rigid transformations`](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Geometry/Transformations/TRRigidTransformations.html) and [`Congruent`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/congruent.html)\r\n`Rigitd transformations` means you play around the shape without expanding or shrinking it.\r\nOr say, without dilation, all translation/rotation/reflection would be `rigid transformation`.\r\n\r\n`Congruent` is the shape after you \"rigid transformed`.\r\nOr say, without dilation, after all translation/rotation/reflection, the shape is called \"congruent\" to the original shape.\r\n\r\n[Khan lecture.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence/transformations-intro-basic-geo/v/introduction-to-transformations)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37207189-dc2ee5e4-23d6-11e8-8a51-3c9b80c63edd.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## [`Dilations`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-dilations/v/example-identifying-the-center-of-dilation)\r\n`Dilation`, just a fancy word for \"resizing\", or \"scaling\".\r\n\r\n### [`Similarity`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/similar.html)\r\nWhen you resize, or say dilate a shape, you call the new shape \"similar\" to the original one.\r\nIf nothing changed with the shape, you call it \"congruent\" to the original one.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37207208-f233a2d0-23d6-11e8-8652-ee0e1a913b02.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### [`Scale factor`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-dilations/v/dilation-scale-factor)\r\nMeans how much you scale the shape, like 2 times bigger, or 2/3 smaller.\r\nNotice:\r\n- The scale factor is of the length of the shape, NOT the area of it.\r\n\r\n#### Scale factors and area\r\n> When you scale the shape, the **area** of the new shape is **(scale facto)² times** to the original one. \r\n\r\n[Khan lecture: Scale factors and area](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-seventh-grade-math/cc-7th-geometry/cc-7th-scale-drawings/v/scale-factors-and-area)\r\nFor Shape A and scaled shape A', it leads to two practical conclusions:\r\n- If we know the `scale factor` is x, then the area of A is x² times to the original one.\r\n- If we know the ratio `(area of A')` ÷ `(area of A)` is x, then the `scale factor` is `√x`\r\n\r\n### `Dilation Center`\r\n\"Dilate the shape ABOUT a point P\", means take the point as a center to dilate the shape.\r\nHow does it work? As the picture below, just simply **scale the distance** from each vertex(point) of the shape to the point.\r\n\r\n#### How to find the dilation center?\r\nThe point P and it's image and dilation center, should be IN ONE LINE !\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37138070-9e925228-22e3-11e8-87d0-1944c461b4c9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37084930-be0f1ede-222e-11e8-9e16-97b5b4fe7003.png)\r\n\r\nIn the example below, you should forget about the `origin` but set the P point as origin and count the distance of each vertex of the triangle: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37137940-027589e6-22e3-11e8-8743-248448836124.png)\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/comments/371085445","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/44#issuecomment-371085445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/44","id":371085445,"user":{"login":"solomonxie","id":14041622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14041622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-07T09:56:06Z","updated_at":"2018-03-07T17:56:44Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"# Area, perimeter, surface, volume of shapes\r\nCheatsheets for calculating area, perimeter, surface, volume of common shapes.\r\n\r\n## [Area of plane shapes ](http://www.mathsisfun.com/area.html)\r\nTriangle, square, rectangle, parallelogram, trapezoid, circle, ellipse, sector.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37085857-17550858-2231-11e8-9e59-6d6273611d47.png)\r\n\r\n## Volume of Cuboids, Rectangular Prisms and Cubes\r\nVolume = Length × Width ×  Height\r\n\r\n## [Volume of Cone, sphere, Cylinder](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/cone-sphere-cylinder.html)\r\nThe volume of a cylinder is: `π × r² × h`\r\nThe volume of a cone is: `1/3 π × r² × h`\r\nThe volume of the sphere is:`4/3 π × r³`\r\n\r\n## [Volume, surface area of Pyramid](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/pyramids.html)\r\n- The **Volume** of a Pyramid: `1/3 × [Base Area] × Height`\r\n- The **Surface Area** of a Pyramid: \r\n    -

What is the `Solutions` to the quadratic\r\n> The `solutions` to the Quadratic Equation are where it is equal to **ZERO.**\r\n\r\nThey are also called **`ROOTS`,** or sometimes **`ZEROS`**, or **`REAL ZEROS`**, OR **`REAL NUMBER ZEROS`**, or **`DISTINCT REAL NUMBER ZEROS`**.\r\nGraphically, when the graph touches `x-axis`, the point is **`A SOLUTION`** to the quadratic equation.\r\n\r\nThere're different ways to get solutions for the quadratic:\r\n- Factor the quadratic as a product of `two binomials`\r\n- Re-group the quadratic, and then factor it\r\n- Use `Quadratic Formula`.\r\n\r\n## To factor a quadratic as the product of two binomials\r\n> To find out the answer quickly and get intuition of it step by step, visit this cheat online solver: [Cymath](https://www.cymath.com/).\r\n\r\nIt's easy to expand product of two binomials to a quadratic, but tricky to factor them back.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37167137-0448086c-233c-11e8-8b0d-c73d21e55baa.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we should do is, in the standard quadratic form `ax² + bx +c = 0`, we are to:\r\n- Find the two common factors of \"c\"\r\n- Be sure the sum of two factors equals to \"b\"\r\nAs the example below, factors of \"c\" could be 4 and 6, and the sum of them is 10. So the answer is `(x+4)(x+6)`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37166444-00c1c662-233a-11e8-9e14-3907f2f56bc8.png)\r\n\r\n## [To factor quadratics by grouping](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/polynomial-factorization/factoring-quadratics-2/a/factoring-by-grouping) (to factor more complicated quadratics)\r\n> When the coefficient of the 2nd degree term is not 1, things get more complicated.\r\n\r\n[Khan notes 1.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/polynomial-factorization/factoring-quadratics-2/a/factoring-by-grouping) \r\n[Khan notes 2.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/polynomial-factorization/factoring-quadratics-2/a/factoring-quadratics-leading-coefficient-not-1)\r\n\r\nThe way to do it is, in the standard form of `Ax²+Bx+C`:\r\n- Find two numbers add up equal `B`\r\n- The product of the two numbers should equal to `A×C`\r\n- Regrouping `Bx` to two terms of `x` with the two number.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37167728-b60c44b8-233d-11e8-942f-de684afa3038.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37167732-baa85d68-233d-11e8-9c4a-490bcac3c832.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Use `Quadratic formula` to solve equation](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/quadratic-equation-derivation.html)\r\n\r\nIf we can't easily `factor the quadratic`, we have to use the `ultimate formula`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37529935-5e830952-2973-11e8-9028-8ba69e0e33bd.png)\r\n\r\nIt's an **universal** method for solving any quadratic equation.\r\n\r\n## [`Discriminant` of a quadratic](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/quadratics/solving-quadratics-using-the-quadratic-formula/a/discriminant-review)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37552091-003c245c-29e9-11e8-9518-fe32deaf237e.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37552225-ef5df86a-29eb-11e8-83bd-eec1659d8504.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the `quadratic formula`, there is a `b2 − 4ac` called `Discriminant`.\r\n\r\n[Refers to Mathwarehouse.](http://www.mathwarehouse.com/quadratic/discriminant-in-quadratic-equation.php)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solutions table as below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37552231-04a49bc0-29ec-11e8-9248-4ed48132f912.png)\r\n\r\nThe meaning of it, is to tell us about `the solution of a quadratic`:\r\n- when `b2 − 4ac` is **POSITIVE**, we get **`TWO Real solutions`**.
