(TRIGONOMETRY)\r\n\r\n- [Khan short video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-trig/hs-geo-trig-ratios-intro/v/basic-trigonometry)\r\n- [Maths is Fun](http://www.mathsisfun.com/sine-cosine-tangent.html)\r\n\r\n## First to know the terms\r\nIt's only applicable to an `Right triangle`.  A right triangle is a triangle with a 90-degree angle.\r\nThe angle we pick out, is called `Θ`, theta. In `vector` related problems, it's also called the `direction angle`, see [this Khan practice](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/e/direction-angles).\r\n\r\nThe side opposite to that angle is called `Opposite`.\r\nThe side next to the angle is called `Adjacent`, \"A-Jason-t\".\r\nThe side is long is called `Hypotenuse`, \"High-po-ten-news`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36719484-1f16b318-1be0-11e8-9038-4e4f9da05fe2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to calculate sine, cosine and tangent of an angle \r\nREMEMBER SHORTCUT: `SOH-CAH-TOA`, pronounced \"so-kah-tow-ah\".\r\n- `S`in = `O`pposite / `H`ypotenuse \r\n- `C`on = `A`djacent / `H`ypotenuse\r\n- `T`an = `O`pposite / `A`djacent\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36720552-5e5182ee-1be3-11e8-92d1-33e1f0218ee8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to calculate the ratio of an angle?\r\nWe want to know what the ratio of an angle is, 60° or 59°?\r\nIf we know `tan(x) = 123`, whatever, then we can get it by `x = tan_inverse(123)`.\r\n`tan_inverse(...)` or `tan⁻¹(...)` are the same.\r\n\r\n## How to calculate the ratio of an `direction angle`\r\n> `direction angle` is a term for vectors. It is the angle we care about for a vector, which is in between of the vector line and the positive side of axis-x.\r\n\r\n**The ratio of a `direction angle` is always drawn from the positive side of axis-x, so that you could know what direction is this vector going to.**\r\n\r\nFor a vector we only know its x-distance and y-distance, so in terms of trigonometry, or in `right triangle`, they're `Opposite` and `Adjacent`.  So that we could use `Tangent` to calculate the ratio, such as `tan⁻¹(y/x)`.\r\n\r\n**But the thing is**, `tan⁻¹(...)` always gives you a number less then 90. So we have to do some tricks for doing this when the direction angle's ratio of a vector is greater than 90, or lesser 0.\r\n\r\nTo classify those situations, we use the idea of `4 quadrant` of the axis system.\r\n\r\n> And once we see x and y, we could immediately identify which quadrant the vector will fall into, then use the different method to calculte as follow:\r\n\r\n### [1st Quadrant ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (+x, +y):\r\n```\r\nRatio =
