# Q: Did God limit man’s life to 120 years?

> Gen. 6:3  Then the LORD said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.”

## Short answer
No. Based on the context, it's very much more likely to say that **God will not endure the corrupted human on earth AT THAT TIME, so God decided to eliminate them in 120 years.**
