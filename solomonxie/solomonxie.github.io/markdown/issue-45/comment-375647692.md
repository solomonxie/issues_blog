### Genesis 6:2
> Does `sons of God` refer to Angels? 
Corrupted angles

### Genesis 6:3
> `120 yrs` could be `human's life span` or the `time before The Flood`. 
But in context it’s more likely to indicate `the life span of human`.

### Genesis 6:4
> `Nephilim`, there reason to mention about him here, might be `for researchers only`. 
Just to let you know it’s not a made up story, which might be found evidence in other histories.

> Bingo! `Came in to` is so important here!
Nowhere mentioned the `angel` has `physical body` and could `make love with human`. 
But here it’s clear they `came into`! 
`A spirit` can come into woman and make her pregnant, 
**SAME with** `Holy Spirit` to Marry and bare Jesus. 
But it’s `lower level spirit`: the angel. 
And this can also explain what happened after the `angles fall`. 
That’s why, right after the verse, God said `it’s not good to live too long`.

### Genesis 6:5
> "**EVERY** intention of thoughts of the heart"
Q: How to understand that?

### Genesis 6:6
> Q: How to understand the `regretted` what God said?

### Genesis 6:7
> Q: What is the `face of the land` ?

### Genesis 6:7
> `God is sorry`? 
Q: How could I understand that

### Genesis 6:13
> What Noah was feeling about it when God said so, 
will exactly be the same feeling of `the righteous people in the future when the Judgement is coming`. The `First Judgement` reflects `The second Judgement`, The `First coming` reflects the `Second coming`.

### Genesis 6:15
> God is the `greatest designer`, and of course he’s `good at carpentry`. 
That makes Jesus a good carpenter too. As a son **inherits** his father’s **talent**.

### Genesis 6:17
> It’s clear that only to destroy the` life that can breath`, not including `plants`, `
Single-celled organisms`, and some `sea creatures`.

### Genesis 6:19
> Noah must have the `world’s biggest zoo` ever, and no one could possibly get beyond it . 
Noah must have the `greatest team of hunters` to collect all those animals on earth and in sky. 
But think of how people’s ages were long and knowledge and experiences were accumulated, 
it probably would be easier than we do now. 
And animals **Might Not** be as various as now, since it’s just a few hundreds of years since beginning.

### Genesis 6:22
> Says so easy, but God knows how hard Noah achieve all those missions. 
Each single one might be a `world class challenge`.
