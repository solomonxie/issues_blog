# `Patriarchs from Adam to Noah` Genesis 5
Review [this page on Answer in Genesis: `Ancient patriarchs in genesis`](https://answersingenesis.org/bible-characters/ancient-patriarchs-in-genesis/) for further details.
Interesting part in this chapter is to find out the each one's `life time overlaps` from Adam to Noah,
means Adam could have taught and talked to Noah's father or grandfather Nosh.

### Genesis 5:4
> Adam had many children. 
That solved the problem of where Cain’s wife came from.

> Q: Where was `Adam` living at during his whole life?

### Genesis 5:29
> Surely `Adam died right before Noah’s birth`. 
According to genealogy in this chapter, `Adam certainly could have spoken to Nosh`, who walked with God. 
And Nosh could have directed instruct Noah about everything.
