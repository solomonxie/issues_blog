## Differ all the basic terms for starters

- `Artificial intelligence`, is a superior area of all those below. But an AI could be human programmed to say something or recognise something, like coding line by line. 
- `Machine Learning`, could be so much better than human coded apps to do something. It lets machine itself to learn things and recognise things. So AI could whether has ML or not. 
- `Deep Learning`, a deeper science based logic for Machine Learning. Seems have something to do with neural something.
- `Data Mining`, machine learning is based of a shit load of data. Like a human learning something needs to encounter many things until he gets it. So Data mining is organising wild informations and provides to Machine learning.
- `Big Data`, means a load of informations, and the skill of Big data means how to handle with the data and how we can get some decisions from it.
