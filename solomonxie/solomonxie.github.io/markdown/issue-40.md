## How to calculate the ratio of an `direction angle`
> `direction angle` is a term for vectors. It is the angle we care about for a vector, which is in between of the vector line and the positive side of axis-x.

**The ratio of a `direction angle` is always drawn from the positive side of axis-x, so that you could know what direction is this vector going to.**

For a vector we only know its x-distance and y-distance, so in terms of trigonometry, or in `right triangle`, they're `Opposite` and `Adjacent`.  So that we could use `Tangent` to calculate the ratio, such as `tan⁻¹(y/x)`.

**But the thing is**, `tan⁻¹(...)` always gives you a number less then 90. So we have to do some tricks for doing this when the direction angle's ratio of a vector is greater than 90, or lesser 0.

To classify those situations, we use the idea of `4 quadrant` of the axis system.

> And once we see x and y, we could immediately identify which quadrant the vector will fall into, then use the different method to calculte as follow:

### [1st Quadrant ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (+x, +y):
```
Ratio = tan⁻¹(y/x)
```

### [2nd Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (-x, +y):
```
Ratio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 180
```

### [3rd Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/more-examples-finding-vector-angles) (-x, -y):
```
Ratio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 180
```

### [4th Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/more-examples-finding-vector-angles) (x, -y):

# Vector's magnitude & direction
> Definition: vector is a **MAGNITUDE** with a **DIRECTION**

Notation: 
- `v` as a vector.
- `|v|` or `||v||` as its **Magnitude**, or **Distance**, or **Absolute value**, same idea
- **Slope** as its **Direction.**
- `(a, b)` the two position there are called `X-component & Y-component`.

It's not hard to understand the basic ideas of a vector, which consists of very basic knowledges form what we learned previously in high school:
- Magnitude of vector: is the same with calculating the **distance of two points**
- Direction of vector: is the same with calculating the **slope of a line**.

### `UNDERSTAND VECTOR'S MOVEMENT`
Now we got a vector start from `(-3,8)` to the point `(4, 5)`.  
We say this vector has a magnitude `||v|| = √40` and has a direction to the bottom right.
But we could also represent the vector as only `one point with two components`: `(7, -3)`.
Which has a **HIDDEN INFORMATION** that it start from the **origin** and direction is to the point `(7, -3)`.
Are they different vectors? NO! They're the same vector, just starts at different places.
> Because **vector doesn't specify where it starts.** A vector only means `A magnitude & a direction`.

That's why we could represent a vector in two ways:
- `v is (-3,8) to (4, 5)`
- `v = (7, -3)`

**IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS IDEA, SO THAT WE COULD FURTHER UNDERSTAND WHY WE COULD MOVE VECTORS, AND BY SO WE COULD DO SUMS AND MULTIPLICATIONS AND SO ON**

## Adding & subtracting vectors
Either adding & subtracting could be seen as a movement to a vector, or say how it travels.

- Subtracting vectors: is just **ADDING** a **NEGATIVE VECTOR**

## Multiplying vectors by SCALAR
> It's the very same with the section `DILATION` or `Scaling` in Geometry. 

Just for review of `dilating` a graph geometrically:
When you scale a graph by a factor:
- Every line of the graph scale by the SAME factor
- Every line will be PARALLEL to its origin line.
