# `Vector & basic operations`
> Definition: vector is a **MAGNITUDE** with a **DIRECTION**

Notation: 
- `v` as a vector.
- `|v|` or `||v||` as its **Magnitude**, or **Distance**, or **Absolute value**, same idea
- **Slope** as its **Direction.**
- `(a, b)` the two position there are called `X-component & Y-component`.

It's not hard to understand the basic ideas of a vector, which consists of very basic knowledges form what we learned previously in high school:
- Magnitude of vector: is the same with calculating the **distance of two points**
- Direction of vector: is the same with calculating the **slope of a line**.

### `UNDERSTAND VECTOR'S MOVEMENT`
Now we got a vector start from `(-3,8)` to the point `(4, 5)`.  
We say this vector has a magnitude `||v|| = âˆš40` and has a direction to the bottom right.
But we could also represent the vector as only `one point with two components`: `(7, -3)`.
Which has a **HIDDEN INFORMATION** that it start from the **origin** and direction is to the point `(7, -3)`.
Are they different vectors? NO! They're the same vector, just starts at different places.
> Because **vector doesn't specify where it starts.** A vector only means `A magnitude & a direction`.

That's why we could represent a vector in two ways:
- `v is (-3,8) to (4, 5)`
- `v = (7, -3)`

**IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS IDEA, SO THAT WE COULD FURTHER UNDERSTAND WHY WE COULD MOVE VECTORS, AND BY SO WE COULD DO SUMS AND MULTIPLICATIONS AND SO ON**

## Adding & subtracting vectors
Adding & subtracting could be seen as a movement to a vector, or say how it travels.

- Subtracting vectors: is just **ADDING** a **NEGATIVE VECTOR**

## Multiplying vectors by SCALAR
> It's the very same with the section `DILATION` or `Scaling` in Geometry. 

Just for review of `dilating` a graph geometrically:
When you scale a graph by a factor:
- Every line of the graph scale by the SAME factor
- Every line will be PARALLEL to its origin line.
