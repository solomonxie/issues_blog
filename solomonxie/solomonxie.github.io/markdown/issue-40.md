# `Vector & basic operations`
> Definition: vector is a **MAGNITUDE** with a **DIRECTION**

Notation: 
- `v` as a vector.
- `|v|` or `||v||` as its **Magnitude**, or **Distance**, or **Absolute value**, same idea
- **Slope or angle** as its **Direction.**
- `(a, b)` the two position there are called `X-component & Y-component`.

It's not hard to understand the basic ideas of a vector, which consists of very basic knowledges form what we learned previously in high school:
- Magnitude of vector: is the same with calculating the **distance of two points**
- Direction of vector: is the same with calculating the **slope of a line**.

### `UNDERSTAND VECTOR'S MOVEMENT`
Now we got a vector start from `(-3,8)` to the point `(4, 5)`.  
We say this vector has a magnitude `||v|| = âˆš40` and has a direction to the bottom right.
But we could also represent the vector as only `one point with two components`: `(7, -3)`.
Which has a **HIDDEN INFORMATION** that it start from the **origin** and direction is to the point `(7, -3)`.
Are they different vectors? NO! They're the same vector, just starts at different places.
> Because **vector doesn't specify where it starts.** A vector only means `A magnitude & a direction`.

That's why we could represent a vector in two ways:
- `v is (-3,8) to (4, 5)`
- `v = (7, -3)`

**IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS IDEA, SO THAT WE COULD FURTHER UNDERSTAND WHY WE COULD MOVE VECTORS, AND BY SO WE COULD DO SUMS AND MULTIPLICATIONS AND SO ON**

## Adding & subtracting vectors
Adding & subtracting could be seen as a movement to a vector, or say how it travels.

- Subtracting vectors: is just **ADDING** a **NEGATIVE VECTOR**

## Multiplying vectors by SCALAR
> It's the very same with the section `DILATION` or `Scaling` in Geometry. 

Just for review of `dilating` a graph geometrically:
When you scale a graph by a factor:
- Every line of the graph scale by the SAME factor
- Every line will be PARALLEL to its origin line.

# Vector forms

[Refer to Khan academy article.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/a/vector-forms-review)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38547847-c2e1b29a-3ce2-11e8-9464-a5fbba606102.png)

## Unit vectors
> Simply say, a `unit vector` is just a vector which magnitude is `1`. Kinda like the unit circle idea.
It's also called `Engineering notation`.

**What's it for?**
Basically just like the unit circle, make things easier to calculate angles or length or so. 
Actually it's working together with unit circle and all other trigonometric knowledges.
so, 
**UNIT VECTOR IS RATHER A TRIGONOMETRIC WAY TO DEAL WITH VECTORS.**
Easier to think about it, is to think about the `Similar graph` knowledge in the `Dilation` section. 

### `Unit vector form`
> `unit vector` is easy, but `unit vector form` needs your bit more effort to understand.

`Unit vector form` assume that there are **TWO** unit vectors, one vertical, one horizontal.

## `Convert between vector forms`

**HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO REVIEW THE COMPLEX NUMBER CONVERSION SKILLS, HAVING THE VERY SAME IDEA.**
[Refer to previous note: complex number forms conversion skills.](https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/44#issuecomment-379646389)

### `How to get the direction (the angle) of a vector`
> It's the very same problem of the topic `Inverse trig function`. 

**NOT EASY! NEED TO CONSIDER LOTS OF CONDITIONS, LIKE QUADRANTS, POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS, PRINCIPLE SOLUTION AND SO. RECOMMEND TO REVIEW INVERSE TRIG FUNCTIONS.**

[Refer to previous notes: Inverse Trigonometric equations.](https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/44#issuecomment-377686394)


# `Matrices`
> `Matrices` are just a **rectangle array of numbers**.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38552009-51700eb2-3ced-11e8-86ce-15a21a9b3c0e.png)

Matrices could be seen as a group of informations arranged **IN A CERTAIN WAY**.
**IT'S SO SO SO SO SO EASIER TO THINK IT AS A SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS.**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38552056-6a3a18fc-3ced-11e8-9f40-bae36f2b775d.png)


## `Matrix row operations and Systems of equations`
> It's very SAME with operations of `systems of equations`.

[Refer to Khan academy article: Matrix row operations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/precalc-matrices/elementary-matrix-row-operations/a/matrix-row-operations)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38552166-dff4d4d8-3ced-11e8-8ae4-3d9144c35473.png)


There're different types of row operations:
- Switch any two rows
- Multiply a row by a nonzero constant
- Add one row to another

They all relate to the operations of systems of equations:
### Switching any two rows:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38552224-08aa1bea-3cee-11e8-93c2-61943babeb98.png)

### Multiply a row by a nonzero constant:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38552233-138a8cca-3cee-11e8-8569-f3a8238e554c.png)

### Add one row to another:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38552241-1c33501e-3cee-11e8-9604-3704346237a7.png)

## `Solve system equations using Matrix`
> it's also called the **`Row-echelon form and Gaussian elimination`**.

First we need to rewrite the system of equation to `matrix` form:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38552612-41076fc8-3cef-11e8-9654-fdadcb7627ba.png)

Then by `row operations`, we need to achieve this kind of result:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38552642-53ad647a-3cef-11e8-9e72-3172da752b5d.png)

It means we eliminated all other variables and only left 1 variable in one equation. Then you could put back the number to the system of equations.
