# Machine Learning note and diary
> By having a wild thought on start a career on Artificial intelligence, started today to do a tiny research on how to study AI. It turns out it consist of a shit black hole of knowledges, which means I have to study all of those things, not mention even some basic terms are causing a headache to me, such like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Mining, Big Data, Classification etc etc. Thus I tend to write down some notes and random thoughts here helping me to organise it better. Saying, a tiny pen is better than a great brain.





## Differ all the basic terms for starters

- `Artificial intelligence`, is a superior area of all those below. But an AI could be human programmed to say something or recognise something, like coding line by line. 
- `Machine Learning`, could be so much better than human coded apps to do something. It lets machine itself to learn things and recognise things. So AI could whether has ML or not. 
- `Deep Learning`, a deeper science based logic for Machine Learning. Seems have something to do with neural something.
- `Data Mining`, machine learning is based of a shit load of data. Like a human learning something needs to encounter many things until he gets it. So Data mining is organising wild informations and provides to Machine learning.
- `Big Data`, means a load of informations, and the skill of Big data means how to handle with the data and how we can get some decisions from it.





Seems Kaggle and Ali Tianchi is a very good start for a beginner like me, and also it will be a good profile tag for a career starter who's without a solid CS background.





### `Data mining` or `web crawling` is not necessary for Machine Learning.  

For instance web crawler is only getting **EXTERNAL** data. But lots of company themselves have already had big data set, like clients' information, patiences' informatin. Only thing they want you to do is how to analyse the data.





# Before starting Machine Learning
> Just want to know what is a real ML engineer, is it being a programmer, or more likely being a data scientist?

# Examples of some categories of ML

## Unsupervised Learning examples
Only received data without any label or instruction, and you ask it to give you the answer.
- Customer. You give a whole book of customer contact list to it, and ask it to tell you what is each customer's salary?
- Language. So you're in a totally strange country and know nothing to their language, and there's no dictionary or any book as reference to your own language, then how do you understand them?
And that is what Unsupervised Learning is gonna do to solve.

## Reinforcement Learning examples
It will receive only SOME info, not by you but by itself, with some practice. 
- A toddler touch hot cup. Reinforcement learning is similar to Child Learning. A kid has curiosity to a hot cup and once he touches it he feels pain. So next time he remembers if he sees some white smoke come from the cup, he doesn't touch it.
- Playing game. You let the computer to play a game without telling it what's the move, and it starts to try every possible move, practise and practise, it remembers every 'fault move' it made and avoid it happens next time. 

## Supervised Learning examples
You feed it info with labels, right or wrong, then give a new data let it decide it's right or wrong.
- Spam and Ham emails. You give ton's of emails with classification label on each of it, let it learn , and let it predict a new email is a spam or ham.

# Types of learning (ML) - Note on Andrew Ng's course

### `Supervised learning`
feeding algorithm data with right answers, so it can predict more accurately.

To be more terminology, it’s also called `REGRESSION`: Predict continues value output.
 
### `CLASSIFICATION`
Depends on each result of the features comparison. A classification could have infinite features for comparing.

### `FEATURES`
A simple question for the data, like is it red or blue? Is its size ranged in large or small? It always falls into a simple output, 0 or 1, or 2,3,4 etc.

### `REGRESSION` problem VS. `CLASSIFICATION` problem?
?

### `UNSUPERVISED LEARNING`
giving an unsupervised algorithm a bunch of data without any label, for instance it don’t know it’s right answer or wrong, but let the machine itself to decide what’s the pattern in it. Simple one is, a CLUSTERING ALGORITHM can help to seperate data set to different clusters, group them, label them.

￼

## Example of `Clustering Algorithm`
`Google News page`, it recognises all similar news and gather to a story board.

Other examples like genes, marketing, social networks etc., also could be having high demands on `CLUSTERING ALGORITHM`, aka `UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHM`.


### `Octave`
a programming language, an alternative to Matlab. Aiming to build a Machine Learning prototype in a few lines of code. Highly recommended by Andrew Ng.






# `Octave`学习
> Matlab实在太贵，所以Andrew Ng推荐的完全开源免费的Octave却是个好的替代物。

## Octave 安装 （命令行中运行）
安装GNU官网的说明，[参考自己的平台安装方式](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html)。Mac上直接`brew install octave`即可。
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36629461-f45176fa-1990-11e8-8c1a-0557abbdbd64.png)
可以看到，octave需要非常多的依赖包。我装了大概一个多小时吧。完成后，就可以通过命令行输入`octave`直接进入了：

## Octave 安装 （包括GUI界面）
参考[官网页面](https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_macOS)。
Mac版的[GUI版Ocatave下载地址](https://sourceforge.net/projects/octave/files/Octave%20MacOSX%20Binary/2016-07-11-binary-octave-4.0.3/octave_gui_403_appleblas.dmg/download)，下载好后是大概300M的dmg文件。
