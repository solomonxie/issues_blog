# `Inverse Matrices`
> There is actually no concept of `division of matrix`. But similarly we can let it `multiply an inverse` to achieve the same goal.

**SPOILER ALERT: EVEN 3x3 MATRIX INVERSE IS ALREADY TOO HEAVY TO CALCULATE, SO BETTER JUST TO MEMORISE THE 2x2  AND LET COMPUTER DO ALL THE HIGHER DIMENSIONS.**

## `Understand the Inverse Matrix`
> 3Blue1Brown's video perfect explained the intuition of it, pretty much everything you need to know.

**It makes lots more sense in geometric meanings, that an Inverse Matrix just to RECOVER the transformation of a graph back to before.**

### Why is the Inverse Matrix on the Left of Vector
Because Matrix `A` is always as a `"Coefficient"` to the vector, or as a `transformation rule` to the vector, so it's always on the left of the vector ( or the graph).

## `Identity Matrix`
> It's a simple yet important notation for doing dividing a matrix.

The `Identity Matrix` is the matrix equals to the number of `1`:

> It's very much more intuitive to think a `identity matrix` as **`one unit vector`**.
- 1-Dimension: `x = 1`
- 2-Dimensions: `v = (1, 1)`
- 3-Dimensions: `v = (1, 1, 1)`

### The features of Identity Matrix
- It is `square` (m×m Matrix)
- It can be large or small (2×2, 3×3, 100×100, ... whatever)
- It has `1`s on the diagonal and `0`s everywhere else
- Its symbol is the capital letter `𝗜`

More importantly, **IT CAN SWITCH SIDE WHEN MULTIPLYING ANOTHER MATIRX!**
It's very special, and is the **ONLY** matrix can IGNORE the order when multiplying another matrix.

## Not Invertible Matirces
Two conditions make a matrix NOT invertible:
- The matrix is not a `Square Matrix` (m×m matrix).
- The `Determinant` is **ZERO**. Such matrix is also called a **`Singular matrix`**

## `Adjugate Matrix`
> It's also called the `Adjoint of a matrix`, or `Classical Adjoint`.

Refer to maths is fun: [Inverse of a Matrix using Minors, Cofactors and Adjugate.](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-inverse-minors-cofactors-adjugate.html)

## `Calculate the Inverse of a Matrix`
> "Calculating it for a 2x2 is fairly straightforward, 3x3 becomes a little bit hairy, 4x4 will take you all day, 5x5 you're almost definitely gonna do a careless mistake if you do an inverse of matrix." - Sal Khan

### 2x2 Matrix inverse
> With a 2x2 matrix, you really don't need to think much and waste time on the full steps, just simply follow this formula `1/Determinant × Adjugate`

### 3x3 Matrix inverse
We can calculate the Inverse of a Matrix by:
- Step 1: calculating the Matrix of Minors,
- Step 2: then turn that into the Matrix of Cofactors,
- Step 3: then the Adjugate, and
- Step 4: multiply that by 1/Determinant.

**I seems not tend to really note the full content here, because it's so useless in normal math life. Because it's way to hairy to calculate even with a 3x3 matrix. So just get the idea and let computer do the rest.**
