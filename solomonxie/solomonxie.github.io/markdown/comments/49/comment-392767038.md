# `Optimization`

Once you've mastered the Derivatives, you would know the `optimization problems` are easy.
It's just a progress to get **the Maximum or Minimum points of a given function.** 

### Example

Solve:
- It's bit tricky to understand the question.
- Form a function: `P(x) = x(a-x) = ax - xÂ²`
- To get a maximum, need to find the critical points first.
- Set `P'(x) = 0` then get `x = a/2`.
- To perform a 2nd Derivative Test: `P''(x) = -2`, means it's Concave Down
- So the critical point `a/2` is a maximum.
