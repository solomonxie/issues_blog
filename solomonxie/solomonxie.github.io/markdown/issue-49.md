# `Limits`
> Limits are all about approaching.


# `Function's Continuity`

Pencil Definition: 
**IF YOU CAN DRAW THE FUNCTION WITH A PENCIL WITHOUT PICKING UP THE PENCIL, THEN THE FUNCTION IS A CONTINUOUS FUNCTION**


# Strategy in finding Limits

# `Limits at infinity`

No matter why kinds of Limits you're looking for, 
to understand it better, 
the best way is to read the `Step-by-Step Solution` from `Symbolab`:
[Limit Calculator from Symbolab.](https://www.symbolab.com/solver/limit-calculator/%5Clim_%7Bx%5Cto%5Cinfty%7D%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B6x%5E%7B2%7D-x%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B9x%5E%7B4%7D%2B7x%5E%7B3%7D%7D%7D%5Cright))

## `Rational functions`
> The KEY point is to look at the powers & coefficients of Numerator & Dominator.
Just the same with `Finding the Asymptote`.

[Refer to previous note on the `How to find Asymptote`](https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/44#issuecomment-374894945).

Example:

Solve:


## `Quotients with square roots`
> The KEY point is to calculate both `numerator & dominator`, then calculate the limit of EACH term with in the square root.

Example:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40047707-c2a05052-5862-11e8-805a-5d8c6ca98d47.png)
Solve:
[Refer to Symbolab step-by-step solution.](https://www.symbolab.com/solver/limit-calculator/%5Clim_%7Bx%5Cto%5Cinfty%7D%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B6x%5E%7B2%7D-x%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B9x%5E%7B4%7D%2B7x%5E%7B3%7D%7D%7D%5Cright))
- Divide by **highest** dominator power to get:

- Calculate separately the limit of `Numerator` & `Dominator`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40047966-896c2990-5863-11e8-924e-8898d747fafd.png)
- Calculate the `Square root`: Need to find limits for **EACH** term **inside** the square root.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40048201-330160c4-5864-11e8-9b7b-b98fbae043f5.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40048216-3c8970b4-5864-11e8-8496-68e2e638df1d.png)
- Then get the result easily.

## `Quotients with trig`
> The KEY point is to apply the **`Squeeze theorem`**, and it is a MUST.

Example:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40047015-e86fb63a-5860-11e8-9f72-b97d62f785c2.png)
Solve:
- Know that `-1 ≦ cos(x) ≦ 1`, so we can tweak it to apply the `squeeze theorem` to get its limit.
- Make the inequality to: `3/-1 ≦ 3/cos(x)/-1 ≦ 3/1`
- Get that right side `3/-1 = -1` and left side `3/1 =1` is not equal.
- So the limit doesn't exist.

**Easier solution steps**:
- Know the inequality `-1 ≦ cos(x) ≦ 1`
- Replace `cos(x)` to ` ±1` in the equation, `3/±1`.
- Calculate limits of two sides.
- If the results are exactly the same, then the limit is the result; Otherwise the limit doesn't exist.

Example 2:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40047463-2181c778-5862-11e8-8658-d439cdcecf65.png)
Solve:
- Know that `-1 ≦ sin(x) ≦ 1`
- Replace `sin(x)` as `±1`
- Left side becomes `(5x+1)/(x-5)`, right side becomes `(5x-1)/(x-5)`
- Both sides' limits are `5`, so the limit exists, and is `5`.


# `All types of discontinuities`

[Refer to Mathwarehouse: What are the types of Discontinuities?](http://www.mathwarehouse.com/calculus/continuity/what-are-types-of-discontinuities.php)

## `Jump Discontinuities`
> A `Jump discontinuity` occurs at some point, the `left side limit` is DIFFERNT with the `right side limit`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40050621-8b4da930-586a-11e8-909f-424af8b6c04e.png)
We see that clearly:

## `Removable Discontinuities`
> A `removable discontinuity` occurs at some point, both `left side limit` & `right side limit` are the SAME.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40050774-0466bc94-586b-11e8-981c-7427d765f794.png)


## `Infinite Discontinuities`
> An `Infinite Discontinuity` occurs  at some point, both `left side` & `right side` are approaching to INFINITY, which means both sides DO NOT have limits.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40050881-5c76418e-586b-11e8-9f03-eb66464a8730.png)


## `Endpoint Discontinuities`
> An `Endpoint Discontinuity` occurs at some point, it DOESN'T HAVE **both** sides, it only has ONE SIDE.

## `Mixed Discontinuities`
