# `L'Hopital's Rule`
`L`Hopital's Rule helps us to find the limit of an `Undefined` limits, like `0/0`, `∞/∞` and such.
It's quite simple to apply and very convenient to solve some problems.

[Refer to `L'Hôpital's rule`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27H%C3%B4pital%27s_rule)

From my experience, the L'Hopital's Rule is so often been used that we didn't even realize. Actually it's been used almost every time when we are to evaluate the **LIMITS OF RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS**.
