# What are sin, cos, tan?  (TRIGONOMETRY)

- [Maths is Fun](http://www.mathsisfun.com/sine-cosine-tangent.html)

## First to know the terms
It's only applicable to an `Right triangle`.  A right triangle is a triangle with a 90-degree angle.
The angle we pick out, is called `Θ`, theta. In `vector` related problems, it's also called the `direction angle`, see [this Khan practice](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/e/direction-angles).

The side opposite to that angle is called `Opposite`.
The side next to the angle is called `Adjacent`, "A-Jason-t".
The side is long is called `Hypotenuse`, "High-po-ten-news`.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36719484-1f16b318-1be0-11e8-9038-4e4f9da05fe2.png)


## How to calculate sine, cosine and tangent of an angle 
REMEMBER SHORTCUT: `SOH-CAH-TOA`, pronounced "so-kah-tow-ah".
- `S`in = `O`pposite / `H`ypotenuse 
- `C`on = `A`djacent / `H`ypotenuse
- `T`an = `O`pposite / `A`djacent

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36720552-5e5182ee-1be3-11e8-92d1-33e1f0218ee8.png)


## How to calculate the ratio of an angle?
We want to know what the ratio of an angle is, 60° or 59°?
If we know `tan(x) = 123`, whatever, then we can get it by `x = tan_inverse(123)`.
`tan_inverse(...)` or `tan⁻¹(...)` are the same.

## How to calculate the ratio of an `direction angle`
> `direction angle` is a term for vectors. It is the angle we care about for a vector, which is in between of the vector line and the positive side of axis-x.

**The ratio of a `direction angle` is always drawn from the positive side of axis-x, so that you could know what direction is this vector going to.**

For a vector we only know its x-distance and y-distance, so in terms of trigonometry, or in `right triangle`, they're `Opposite` and `Adjacent`.  So that we could use `Tangent` to calculate the ratio, such as `tan⁻¹(y/x)`.

**But the thing is**, `tan⁻¹(...)` always gives you a number less then 90. So we have to do some tricks for doing this when the direction angle's ratio of a vector is greater than 90, or lesser 0.

To classify those situations, we use the idea of `4 quadrant` of the axis system.

> And once we see x and y, we could immediately identify which quadrant the vector will fall into, then use the different method to calculte as follow:

### [1st Quadrant ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (+x, +y):
```
Ratio = tan⁻¹(y/x)
```

### [2nd Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (-x, +y):
```
Ratio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 180

# Mean absolute deviation - MAD  (STATS)
`The deviation` is the distance from the value to the `mean` value. 
It's used to describe how the values looks like or how they're laid on the axis, are they close to each other or far away.

The `Mean absolute deviation` is the absolute average of all deviations.

# [Complementary, supplementary, vertical angles](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-angle/vert-comp-supp-angles/a/complementary-and-supplementary-angles-review)

- `Complementary angles` are two angles with a **sum of 90°**. A common case is when they form a right angle.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37080149-3392edf2-2220-11e8-96ea-b03512887b40.png)

- `Supplementary angles` are two angles with a **sum of 180°.** A common case is when they lie on the same side of a straight line.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37080204-5c885d32-2220-11e8-9df0-ce1c67854c3f.png)

- `Vertical angles` are angles opposite each other where two lines cross. A pair of vertical angles **have the same measure** of angle.

# [`Transformations`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence) (GEOMETRY)
> Transformation means something's changing, transforming. 

Types of transformations:
- [`Translations`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-transformations-intro/a/intro-to-translations): Move the shape. In geometry, a translation moves a thing up and down or left and right.
- [`Rotation`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-transformations-intro/a/intro-to-rotations): Rotate the shape. In geometry, rotations make things turn in a cycle around a definite center point. 
- [`Reflection`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence/basic-geo-reflections/a/reflecting-shapes): Mirror the shape. A reflection is a transformation that acts like a mirror: It swaps all pairs of points that are on exactly opposite sides of the line of reflection.
- [`Dilation`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence/basic-geo-dilations/v/dilating-from-an-arbitrary-point-example): Expand or shrink the shape.

## [`Rigid transformations`](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Geometry/Transformations/TRRigidTransformations.html)
Means you transform the shape without changing the shape.
Or say, exclude dilation, all translation/rotation/reflection would be `rigid transformation`.

[Khan lecture.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence/transformations-intro-basic-geo/v/introduction-to-transformations)

## Dilations [center](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-dilations/v/example-identifying-the-center-of-dilation) and [scale factor](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-dilations/v/dilation-scale-factor)

### `Dilation Center`
"Dilate the shape ABOUT a point P", means take the point as a center to dilate the shape.
How does it work? As the picture below, just simply **scale the distance** from each vertex(point) of the shape to the point.

#### How to find the dilation center?
The point P and it's image and dilation center, should be IN ONE LINE !

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37138070-9e925228-22e3-11e8-87d0-1944c461b4c9.png)

In the example below, you should forget about the `origin` but set the P point as origin and count the distance of each vertex of the triangle: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37137940-027589e6-22e3-11e8-8743-248448836124.png)

    - When all side faces are the same: `[Base Area] + 1/2 × Perimeter × [Slant Length]`
    - When side faces are different: `[Base Area] + [Lateral Area]`


# [Rational & irrational numbers](http://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html)
A rational number can always be expressed as a `fraction of two integers`.
vice versa, a irrational number cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers.

`A square root of a non-perfect square` is an irrational number, because it cannot be expressed as the fraction of two integers.

# [Stem and Leaf Plots](http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/stem-leaf-plots.html)

[Khan lecture.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-math-reasoning/pre-algebra-stem-leaf/v/reading-stem-and-leaf-plots)

A `Stem and Leaf Plot` is a special table where each data value is split into a "stem" (the first digit or digits) and a "leaf" (usually the last digit).

In the above plot: 
- The `stem column` means the tens number of the whole number.
- The `row column` means the ones number of the whole number.
For example, the numbers of the second row represent: 12, 13, 15.

How the `Stem and Leaf Plot` represent numbers, it depends on the context. Stem can represents number of tens place, or ones place; Leaf can represents ones place or even decimal places.

# Proportional relationship
Linearly, if x and y has a relationship that one is another's proportion, then they have a `proportional relationship`. Expression as:
`y/x = k.`

Or it's a version of linear equation `y=mx +b`, only the b=0, then `y=mx`.

At the showing image above, only first one shows a proportional relationship. The other two are not linear and going through origin.
