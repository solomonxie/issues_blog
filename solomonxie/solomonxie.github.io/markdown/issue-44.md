# What are sine, cosine, tangent?  (TRIGONOMETRY)

- [Khan short video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-trig/hs-geo-trig-ratios-intro/v/basic-trigonometry)
- [Maths is Fun](http://www.mathsisfun.com/sine-cosine-tangent.html)

## First to know the terms
It's only applicable to an `Right triangle`.  A right triangle is a triangle with a 90-degree angle.
The angle we pick out, is called `Θ`, theta. In `vector` related problems, it's also called the `direction angle`, see [this Khan practice](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/e/direction-angles).

The side opposite to that angle is called `Opposite`.
The side next to the angle is called `Adjacent`, "A-Jason-t".
The side is long is called `Hypotenuse`, "High-po-ten-news`.

## How to calculate sine, cosine and tangent of an angle 
REMEMBER SHORTCUT: `SOH-CAH-TOA`, pronounced "so-kah-tow-ah".
- `S`in = `O`pposite / `H`ypotenuse 
- `C`on = `A`djacent / `H`ypotenuse
- `T`an = `O`pposite / `A`djacent

## How to calculate the ratio of an angle?
We want to know what the ratio of an angle is, 60° or 59°?
If we know `tan(x) = 123`, whatever, then we can get it by `x = tan_inverse(123)`.
`tan_inverse(...)` or `tan⁻¹(...)` are the same.


## Reciprocal trig ratios: `Cosecant`, `Secant`, `Cotangent`

[Khan notes.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry-home/right-triangles-topic/reciprocal-trig-ratios-geo/a/reciprocal-trig-ratios)

- Cosecant: `csc(θ) = 1 / sin(θ)`
- Secant: `sec(θ) = 1 / cos(θ)`
- Cotangent: `cot(θ) = 1 / tan(θ)`

# Mean absolute deviation - MAD  (STATS)
`The deviation` is the distance from the value to the `mean` value. 
It's used to describe how the values looks like or how they're laid on the axis, are they close to each other or far away.

The `Mean absolute deviation` is the absolute average of all deviations.

[Khan lecture.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geometry-pythagorean-theorem/pythagorean-theorem-distance/v/example-finding-distance-with-pythagorean-theorem)

Easy way to do this:
Make a triangle with two points same with the given points, and solve the length of the triangle.

# [`Pythagorean theorem`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/pythagoras.html) (TRIANGLE)
勾股定理。
Pronounced: `Pe~'tha-gor-rean 'Theor-rem`
In a right angled triangle:
the square of the hypotenuse is equal to
the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37077006-f34959c2-2213-11e8-8ecf-70ae86c4b6b6.png)

# [`Triangle inequality theorem`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/triangle-inequality-theorem.html)
In a triangle, the sides always follow these two rules:
- Any side of a triangle is always **shorter** than the sum of the other two sides
- The third side must be also **larger** than the difference between the other two sides

Example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37251267-c494ccc4-2547-11e8-9615-eff353c66ac3.png)



# [Complementary, supplementary, vertical angles](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-angle/vert-comp-supp-angles/a/complementary-and-supplementary-angles-review)

- `Complementary angles` are two angles with a **sum of 90°**. A common case is when they form a right angle.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37080149-3392edf2-2220-11e8-96ea-b03512887b40.png)

- `Supplementary angles` are two angles with a **sum of 180°.** A common case is when they lie on the same side of a straight line.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37080204-5c885d32-2220-11e8-9df0-ce1c67854c3f.png)

- `Vertical angles` are angles opposite each other where two lines cross. A pair of vertical angles **have the same measure** of angle.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37080400-1467f0f2-2221-11e8-8621-382103ebb943.png)



# [`Transformations`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence) (GEOMETRY)

> Transformation means something's changing, transforming. 

Types of transformations:
- [`Translations`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-transformations-intro/a/intro-to-translations): Slide or move the shape. In geometry, a translation moves a thing up and down or left and right.
- [`Rotation`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-transformations-intro/a/intro-to-rotations): Turn or rotate the shape. In geometry, rotations make things turn in a cycle around a definite center point. 
- [`Reflection`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence/basic-geo-reflections/a/reflecting-shapes): Flip or mirror the shape. A reflection is a transformation that acts like a mirror: It swaps all pairs of points that are on exactly opposite sides of the line of reflection.
- [`Dilation`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence/basic-geo-dilations/v/dilating-from-an-arbitrary-point-example): Expand or shrink the shape.

And,
you can group above types of transformations into two groups: `Rigid transformations` and `Dilations`

## [`Rigid transformations`](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Geometry/Transformations/TRRigidTransformations.html) and [`Congruent`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/congruent.html)

> `Rigitd transformations` means you play around the shape without expanding or shrinking it.
Or say, without dilation, all translation/rotation/reflection would be `rigid transformation`.

`Congruent` is the shape after you "rigid transformed`.
Or say, without dilation, after all translation/rotation/reflection, the shape is called "congruent" to the original shape.

[Khan lecture.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence/transformations-intro-basic-geo/v/introduction-to-transformations)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37207189-dc2ee5e4-23d6-11e8-8a51-3c9b80c63edd.png)


## [`Dilations`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-dilations/v/example-identifying-the-center-of-dilation)

> `Dilation`, just a fancy word for "resizing", or "scaling".

Notice that: Dilation **DOES NOT** change any angle within the shape.
Don't get confused with a `horizontal stretch`, which **does change** both sides and angles.

### [`Similarity`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/similar.html)

> When you resize, or say dilate a shape, you call the new shape **`similar`** to the original one.
If nothing changed with the shape, you call it **`congruent`** to the original one.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37207208-f233a2d0-23d6-11e8-8652-ee0e1a913b02.png)


### [`Scale factor`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-dilations/v/dilation-scale-factor)

> Means how much you scale the shape, like 2 times bigger, or 2/3 smaller.

Notice:
- The scale factor is of the length of the shape, NOT the area of it.

#### Scale factors and area
> When you scale the shape, the **area** of the new shape is **(scale facto)² times** to the original one. 

[Khan lecture: Scale factors and area](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-seventh-grade-math/cc-7th-geometry/cc-7th-scale-drawings/v/scale-factors-and-area)

For Shape A and scaled shape A', it leads to two practical conclusions:
- If we know the `scale factor` is x, then the area of A is x² times to the original one.
- If we know the ratio `(area of A')` ÷ `(area of A)` is x, then the `scale factor` is `√x`

### `Dilation Center`

>"Dilate the shape ABOUT a point P", means take the point as a center to dilate the shape.

How does it work? As the picture below, just simply **scale the distance** from each vertex(point) of the shape to the point.

#### How to find the dilation center?
> The point P and it's image and dilation center, should be IN ONE LINE !

In the above plot: 
- The `stem column` means the tens number of the whole number.
- The `row column` means the ones number of the whole number.
For example, the numbers of the second row represent: 12, 13, 15.

How the `Stem and Leaf Plot` represent numbers, it depends on the context. Stem can represents number of tens place, or ones place; Leaf can represents ones place or even decimal places.

# Proportional relationship
Linearly, if x and y has a relationship that one is another's proportion, then they have a `proportional relationship`. Expression as:
`y/x = k.`

Or it's a version of linear equation `y=mx +b`, only the b=0, then `y=mx`.

## Different forms a quadratic
> There're many tricks to convert one form to another, mainly depends on what information we have and what information we'd like to get.

Common forms for quadratic as below:
- `Standard form`: 
- `Two binomials form`: Could get two solutions without calculator.
- `Perfect square form`: Could get the positions of `vertex` by only eyeballing it. In another way, you could tell how much the graph was moved from the `origin point`.



## What is the `Solutions` to the quadratic
> The `solutions` to the Quadratic Equation are where it is equal to **ZERO.**

They are also called **`ROOTS`,** or sometimes **`ZEROS`**, or **`REAL ZEROS`**, OR **`REAL NUMBER ZEROS`**, or **`DISTINCT REAL NUMBER ZEROS`**.
Graphically, when the graph touches `x-axis`, the point is **`A SOLUTION`** to the quadratic equation.

There're different ways to get solutions for the quadratic:
- Factor the quadratic as a product of `two binomials`
- Re-group the quadratic, and then factor it
- Use `Quadratic Formula`.

## To factor a quadratic as the product of two binomials
> To find out the answer quickly and get intuition of it step by step, visit this cheat online solver: [Cymath](https://www.cymath.com/).

It's easy to expand product of two binomials to a quadratic, but tricky to factor them back.

What we should do is, in the standard quadratic form `ax² + bx +c = 0`, we are to:
- Find the two common factors of "c"
- Be sure the sum of two factors equals to "b"
As the example below, factors of "c" could be 4 and 6, and the sum of them is 10. So the answer is `(x+4)(x+6)`

[Khan notes 2.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/polynomial-factorization/factoring-quadratics-2/a/factoring-quadratics-leading-coefficient-not-1)

The way to do it is, in the standard form of `Ax²+Bx+C`:
- Find two numbers add up equal `B`
- The product of the two numbers should equal to `A×C`
- Regrouping `Bx` to two terms of `x` with the two number.

The meaning of it, is to tell us about `the solution of a quadratic`:
- when `b2 − 4ac` is **POSITIVE**, we get **`TWO Real solutions`**. (It touches `x-axis` twice.)

- when it is **NEGETIVE** we get **`TWO Complex solutions`**. (It won't touch `x-axis` at all.)

A `parabola` always has a `vertex`, either its `top point` or `bottom point`.
If you draw a **vertical line** goes through the `vertex`, it can divided the graph into `two mirrored part`.

## The `Concavity` of parabola
- When it opens up, we also call it `Concave up`,
- When it opens down, we also call it `Concave down`.


## [`Equation forms` of a Parabola](http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/parabola/standard-and-vertex-form.php)

There're two common forms of equation to express the parabola:
`Standard form` and `Vertex form`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37553117-5e6d56fa-29fc-11e8-8bab-5a7be851e55b.png)

And there's another form for the parabola: 
the `Factor form`.

## [How to get the `Axis of symmetry`](http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/parabola/axis-of-symmetry.php)

> For a parabola, the `Axis of symmetry` goes through the `vertex`, which represent the `x position` of the `vertex`.

The `formula equation` of Axis of symmetry:
- In the `Vertex form` of quadratic `y = (x-h)² + k`, the symmetry line is: **`x = h`**. 
Mind that, to understand this form, refers to the `Absolute value graph` notion.

- In the `Factor form` of quadratic `y=c(x-a)(x-b)`, the symmetry line is: **`x=(a+b)/2`**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37553110-31e45b1a-29fc-11e8-9fc6-093562f5d4ed.png)

## How to get the `Vertex`
Getting the `Axis of symmetry` is half way to get the `vertex`, since it can only represent the `x position` of vertex. 
For getting the `y position`, just input the `x value` into the equation, and get the `y value`.
Solved.

It's easier to get the vertex in the `factor form` of quadratic:

Then the `vertex` is `(h, k)`.

## How to graph the quadratic
To graph a quadratic, we have a few different ways, and each needs the information of a few points:
- A `vertex` point, two `root` points.
- A `vertex` point, a `y-intersect` point.
- A `vertex` point, any two points on the graph.

[Refer this page to review how to get a parabola's intersects.](http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/parabola/parabola-intercepts.php)

- To get two `roots`:
Just solve the equation and get two solutons (if there're two solutions).

- To get the `y-intersect` point:
Simply let the `x=0`, 
and solve the quadratic to get `y` position of the vertex.
And input the `y` value to the equation, to solve `x` position. Then we get the vertex:
`(x, y)`

- To get `any two points` of the graph:
Just ASSUME two `x positions`,
then input to the quadratic, to get `y positions`. Then we get:
`(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`

### Equation for the parabola

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37862802-13658492-2f8e-11e8-8c65-1f1cd9950c71.png)

In this graph above, we will get an equation by `Pythagorean Theorem`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37862810-2c106f8e-2f8e-11e8-98b5-fa078ec2cb4e.png)

And expand that equation, we got a parabola equation in `Vertex quadratic form`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37862814-52196fa0-2f8e-11e8-9b73-5d6d07569112.png)

```py
y = c (x - i)² + j
```
So we could spot out the `focus` and `directrix` information from a vertex quadratic equation.
In which, the `(i, j)` represent the `vertex`, `(h, k)` represents the `focus`, and the `y=k` represents the `directrix`.
