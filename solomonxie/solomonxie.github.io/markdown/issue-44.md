Just round every number to the nearest tens and then make calculation.
It then will be: 180 burgers, 60 sandwiches, and 40 salads, add together to 280.
Same as below:

- `Isosceles triangles` with 2 equal sides   (sounds "i-saw-sillys")
- `Equilateral triangles` with 3 equal sides  (sounds "e-qui-lateral")

### Types by angles
- `Acute triangles` with 3 acute angles
- `Obtuse triangles` with 1 obtuse angle

[Khan academy lession.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-volume-sa/basic-geometry-surface-area/v/nets-of-polyhedra)

Polyhedra, or Polyhedrons is plural for Polyhedron. means a 3D shape with surfaces all flat.
Examples: `Cube`, `Triangular Prism`, `Pyramids`

# [`Prisms`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/prisms.html)  - 3D shape
A `Prism` is a 3D shape, which could be stretch out from a 2D shape with sides all straight. The 2D shape is called `Cross-Section`.
A prism is a `polyhedron`, which means all faces are flat!

# `Mean`, `median`, & `mode` numbers  (STATS)
[Khan lecture.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/data-distributions-a1/summarizing-center-distributions/v/mean-median-and-mode)

- `Mean number` is just an average of all numbers listed.
- `Median number` is the middle positioned number in a ordered `number set` (means no duplicates). If there're two middles, then average them to get a median number.
- `Mode number` is the number shows up most times in a list.

# What are sin, cos, tan?  (TRIGONOMETRY)

- [Maths is Fun](http://www.mathsisfun.com/sine-cosine-tangent.html)

## First to know the terms
It's only applicable to an `Right triangle`.  A right triangle is a triangle with a 90-degree angle.
The angle we pick out, is called `Θ`, theta. In `vector` related problems, it's also called the `direction angle`, see [this Khan practice](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/e/direction-angles).

The side opposite to that angle is called `Opposite`.
The side next to the angle is called `Adjacent`, "A-Jason-t".
The side is long is called `Hypotenuse`, "High-po-ten-news`.

## How to calculate sine, cosine and tangent of an angle 
REMEMBER SHORTCUT: `SOH-CAH-TOA`, pronounced "so-kah-tow-ah".
- `S`in = `O`pposite / `H`ypotenuse 
- `C`on = `A`djacent / `H`ypotenuse
- `T`an = `O`pposite / `A`djacent

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36720552-5e5182ee-1be3-11e8-92d1-33e1f0218ee8.png)


## How to calculate the ratio of an angle?
We want to know what the ratio of an angle is, 60° or 59°?
If we know `tan(x) = 123`, whatever, then we can get it by `x = tan_inverse(123)`.
`tan_inverse(...)` or `tan⁻¹(...)` are the same.

## How to calculate the ratio of an `direction angle`
> `direction angle` is a term for vectors. It is the angle we care about for a vector, which is in between of the vector line and the positive side of axis-x.

**The ratio of a `direction angle` is always drawn from the positive side of axis-x, so that you could know what direction is this vector going to.**

For a vector we only know its x-distance and y-distance, so in terms of trigonometry, or in `right triangle`, they're `Opposite` and `Adjacent`.  So that we could use `Tangent` to calculate the ratio, such as `tan⁻¹(y/x)`.

**But the thing is**, `tan⁻¹(...)` always gives you a number less then 90. So we have to do some tricks for doing this when the direction angle's ratio of a vector is greater than 90, or lesser 0.

To classify those situations, we use the idea of `4 quadrant` of the axis system.

> And once we see x and y, we could immediately identify which quadrant the vector will fall into, then use the different method to calculte as follow:

### [1st Quadrant ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (+x, +y):
```
Ratio = tan⁻¹(y/x)
```

### [2nd Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (-x, +y):
```
Ratio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 180
```

### [3rd Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/more-examples-finding-vector-angles) (-x, -y):
```
Ratio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 180
```

### [4th Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/more-examples-finding-vector-angles) (x, -y):

# Mean absolute deviation - MAD  (STATS)
`The deviation` is the distance from the value to the `mean` value. 
It's used to describe how the values looks like or how they're laid on the axis, are they close to each other or far away.

The `Mean absolute deviation` is the absolute average of all deviations.
