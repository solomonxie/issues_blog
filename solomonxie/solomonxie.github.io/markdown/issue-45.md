# `The creation` Genesis 1~2

## Gen 1
Genesis one is all about how the universe and all creatures were created. 

### Gen 1:21
> Sea creatures first , then the rest earth creatures .
Response to the made up idea of `Evolution`

### Gen 1:22
> It was amazingly deep in the word `blessing`.
**First blessing of the universe**

> `Multiply` to the living creatures is not only a blessing, but root in living creatures’ nature. 
`Sex` was a blessing at the first place. 
Only when the creature abuses it, it becomes a sin. 

> Besides, 
Q: what’s the meaning of letting bird multiply on earth ?

### Gen 1:24
> In KJV, it’s `in his kind`
Q: Not sure what it means 

> Q: What exactly is the “creeping things” ?

### Gen 1:27
> Repeated twice : image of God

### Gen 1:30
> For every creatures He has given `green plants` as food. 
Before any killing, we are all VEGETARIANS.

## Gen 2
Genesis two is mainly to detail the creations from chapter one.

### Gen 2:3
> God made the seventh day HOLY.
Q: How is it holy? It must be different from other days. Should we consider one day is holy than another?

### Gen 2:5
> Time theory
No plants had yet sprung up because no rain. 
There’s the idea against `Evolution`: 
It seems **time was frozen** for the plants, can’t die or grow. 
Time was not moving until the rain drop down.
We could apply the same way about time to: stars, lights, living creatures. 

### Gen 2:7
> `The breath of life`.
Q: What’s so special about that breath, why does it have to be breath than other way?

### Gen 2:8
> God created man first, **AFTER** it created the garden.

> Garden is in the `east`. So it’s not always bad in the bible about the east.
(In the bible, when God punish someone, He often let him go east.)

### Gen 2:9
> God made trees in garden that either **pleasant to sight** or **good for food**, 
Q: so which one that `tree of life` and `tree of knowledge` belong to ?
TOL good for sight, or TOK good for food?

- Gen 3:6 answered: TOK is both good for food and sight, and brings cleverness .

> `Tree of knowledge of good and evil`
Q: Does it mean it only has the knowledge about good and evil, not all knowledge?

### Gen 2:15
> God let man to be steward in the garden to take care of it, like an assistant. 
Doesn't it depict the `original relationship` designed between God and man . 

### Gen 2:17
> God knows what will happen that man will sin but still warn him. 
What was God thinking then?
I could say , **knowing what will happen is not the reason for what He should do**.
And God must not be trapped by the `time theory` or `butterfly effect`, 
nor force Himself to make the future happen. 
It could be the best way to do so among all other way, 
or even it could be His favourite way among all other ways.
To think about this question, must have a strong intuition about time theory or related idea. 
Couldn’t just say that: why should God put tree of knowledge here at first place.

### Gen 2:18
> God wants Adam to have a helper, 
notice that: here God did not just made Eva all of sudden, 
but led all living creatures to Adam and let him choose.
But he didn’t choose anyone as a helper, 
after all that, God made the idea to make a woman for him.


### Gen 2:21
> God causes a `deep sleep` upon man and took out his rib:
`World’s first surgery`, with strong `anaesthetic`. 
Not "sleep" but "deep sleep", so he could t feel pain.

### Gen 2:22
> Sounds like `gene clone project`: 
take a part of human and make a copy , with altered DNA.
Can’t say God is not `the first and the best doctor and biologist`.




# `Human's fall` Genesis 3
Genesis three is the start of `Human's Fall`.

### Gen 3:1
> "Now" the serpent...
Q: `Now` emphasise the time moving or the nature of a living creature’s changing? 

> It’s more crafty than any other beast: 
Q: what’s the definition of `crafty` here? 
Is it sin, is it impurity or heart of hurting others ? 
Or it’s simply just a way to say cleverness?

> Q: Why didn’t the serpent **speak to man first**? 
Q: What would happen if it spoke to man first. 
Q: Did it ever talk to the man at all ?

### Gen 3:3
> Eva was citing God’s command and also add something new to it, which was coming from nowhere. 
That’s a very interesting thing to dig in. 
what would you say what was happening there referring to Eva's action? 
Could you say it's all serpent's fault?
Adding things to God's first rule, it was **the first mistake** mentioned in the Bible.
Did the serpent did something wrong? It seemed not, but yes it did!
It questioned God's rule, that human wouldn't surely die after eating fruit from the tree of knowledge. It's a huge wrong to question God's authority and God's rule, it was a sin!
Q: But is the term "sin" applicable for animals?

### Gen 3:6
> 3 main good effect of `tree of knowledge` .

### Gen 3:7
> They hadn't had sex yet to make baby. Because before they know they're naked, they don't seem to have idea about it. 

### Genesis 3:8
> Q: Why is there a sound of God’s walking? 
God is spirit not physical, so what’s the meaning of God to walk here? 
When man sins, he’s afraid of president himself before God. He is the first one doing that.

### Genesis 3:16
> Woman’s desire shall be contrary to husband. 
Q: What’s the meaning of this ?

> Adam became like them, not all like them, but “in knowing good and evil”

### Genesis 3:24
> Q: What’s the purpose of setting them to protect the tree of life? 
Can’t God just remove it or just ruin the garden? 
Or does it even need a protection since God knows everything and can protect it from everywhere. Only thing I can guess of is that God just set a visible warning for human not to do stupid things to come, so that human won’t be hurt. 
So it’s because God love man, that’s why He set up the visible sign to keep them away. 
Q: And again what’s meaning of maintaining the tree? 
All I can think of is that one day we will return ? 
Where is this garden? In my imagination, it’s a mystery place like the frog island in Naruto. 

> Only setup protection at east of the gate. People only come from east would try to break it?

Answered: Cain was set to the east.



# `Cain’s psychology, biology and genealogy` Genesis 4

### Genesis 4:1
> Q: “Know his wife” is only meaning making sex? 
Or there’s something else more deep meaning in it? 

> Eve got baby because of God’s help. 
Q: What’s specific help is it?

### Genesis 4:7
> The “sin’s desire is contrary to you. 
Q: Sin has desire?

>  “You shall rule over it!” “If you do well...” 
means Cain didn’t do well on offering. 
His offering must be less as good as Abel’s, or could be even worse, that he was not offering by will.

### Genesis 4:8
> Q: What did Cain speak to Abel before killed him?

### Genesis 4:14
> “Every one finds me...” 
Not specifically says human or animal. 
Most probably beast, because after Adam’s sin, animal start killing too. 
Beasts were all over the place , 
a man like Cain grew up in protection had no way to know how to survive from them.

### Genesis 4:17
> That’s the place makes confusion: 
where did this woman come from ?
Answered later on Gen 5:4.

### Genesis 4:17
> He built a city, 
there couldn’t be Cain’s one family, 
must be a large group of people already existed there already.
