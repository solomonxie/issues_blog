# `The creation` Genesis 1~2

## Gen 1
Genesis one is all about how the universe and all creatures were created. 

### Gen 1:21
> Sea creatures first , then the rest earth creatures .
Response to the made up idea of `Evolution`

### Gen 1:22
> It was amazingly deep in the word `blessing`.
**First blessing of the universe**

> `Multiply` to the living creatures is not only a blessing, but root in living creatures’ nature. 
`Sex` was a blessing at the first place. 
Only when the creature abuses it, it becomes a sin. 

> Besides, 
Q: what’s the meaning of letting bird multiply on earth ?

### Gen 1:24
> In KJV, it’s `in his kind`
Q: Not sure what it means 

> Q: What exactly is the “creeping things” ?

### Gen 1:27
> Repeated twice : image of God

### Gen 1:30
> For every creatures He has given `green plants` as food. 
Before any killing, we are all VEGETARIANS.

## Gen 2
Genesis two is mainly to detail the creations from chapter one.

### Gen 2:3
> God made the seventh day HOLY.
Q: How is it holy? It must be different from other days. Should we consider one day is holy than another?

### Gen 2:5
> Time theory
No plants had yet sprung up because no rain. 
There’s the idea against `Evolution`: 
It seems **time was frozen** for the plants, can’t die or grow. 
Time was not moving until the rain drop down.
We could apply the same way about time to: stars, lights, living creatures. 

### Gen 2:7
> `The breath of life`.
Q: What’s so special about that breath, why does it have to be breath than other way?

### Gen 2:8
> God created man first, **AFTER** it created the garden.

> Garden is in the `east`. So it’s not always bad in the bible about the east.
(In the bible, when God punish someone, He often let him go east.)

### Gen 2:9
> God made trees in garden that either **pleasant to sight** or **good for food**, 
Q: so which one that `tree of life` and `tree of knowledge` belong to ?
TOL good for sight, or TOK good for food?

- Gen 3:6 answered: TOK is both good for food and sight, and brings cleverness .

> `Tree of knowledge of good and evil`
Q: Does it mean it only has the knowledge about good and evil, not all knowledge?

### Gen 2:15
> God let man to be steward in the garden to take care of it, like an assistant. 
Doesn't it depict the `original relationship` designed between God and man . 

### Gen 2:17
> God knows what will happen that man will sin but still warn him. 
What was God thinking then?
I could say , **knowing what will happen is not the reason for what He should do**.
And God must not be trapped by the `time theory` or `butterfly effect`, 
nor force Himself to make the future happen. 
It could be the best way to do so among all other way, 
or even it could be His favourite way among all other ways.
To think about this question, must have a strong intuition about time theory or related idea. 
Couldn’t just say that: why should God put tree of knowledge here at first place.

### Gen 2:18
> God wants Adam to have a helper, 
notice that: here God did not just made Eva all of sudden, 
but led all living creatures to Adam and let him choose.
But he didn’t choose anyone as a helper, 
after all that, God made the idea to make a woman for him.


### Gen 2:21
> God causes a `deep sleep` upon man and took out his rib:
`World’s first surgery`, with strong `anaesthetic`. 
Not "sleep" but "deep sleep", so he could t feel pain.

### Gen 2:22
> Sounds like `gene clone project`: 
take a part of human and make a copy , with altered DNA.
Can’t say God is not `the first and the best doctor and biologist`.




# `The First Man's fall` Genesis 3
Genesis three is the start of `Human's Fall`.

### Gen 3:1
> "Now" the serpent...
Q: `Now` emphasise the time moving or the nature of a living creature’s changing? 

> It’s more crafty than any other beast: 
Q: what’s the definition of `crafty` here? 
Is it sin, is it impurity or heart of hurting others ? 
Or it’s simply just a way to say cleverness?

> Q: Why didn’t the serpent **speak to man first**? 
Q: What would happen if it spoke to man first. 
Q: Did it ever talk to the man at all ?

### Gen 3:3
> Eva was citing God’s command and also add something new to it, which was coming from nowhere. 
That’s a very interesting thing to dig in. 
what would you say what was happening there referring to Eva's action? 
`Gossip`, is the original fault Eve made.
Could you say it's all serpent's fault?
Adding things to God's first rule, it was **the first mistake** mentioned in the Bible.
Did the serpent did something wrong? It seemed not, but yes it did!
It questioned God's rule, that human wouldn't surely die after eating fruit from the tree of knowledge. It's a huge wrong to question God's authority and God's rule, it was a sin!
Q: But is the term "sin" applicable for animals?

### Gen 3:6
> 3 main good effect of `tree of knowledge` .

### Gen 3:7
> They hadn't had sex yet to make baby. 
Before they know they're naked, they don't seem to have idea about it. 

### Genesis 3:8
> Q: Why is there a `sound of God’s walking`? 
God is spirit not physical, so what’s the meaning of God to walk here? 
When man sins, he’s afraid of president himself before God. Adam is the first one doing that.

### Genesis 3:16
> Woman’s desire shall be contrary to husband. 
Q: What’s the meaning of this ?

> Adam became like them, not all like them, but `in knowing good and evil`

### Genesis 3:24
> Q: What’s the purpose of setting them `to protect the tree of life`? 
Can’t God just remove it or just ruin the garden? 
Or does it even need a protection since God knows everything and can protect it from everywhere. Only thing I can guess of is that God just set a visible warning for human not to do stupid things to come, so that human won’t be hurt. 
So it’s because God love man, that’s why He set up the visible sign to keep them away. 

> Q: And again what’s meaning of maintaining the tree? 
All I can think of is that one day we will return ? 
Where is this garden? In my imagination, it’s a mystery place like the frog island in Naruto. 

> Only setup protection at `east of the gate`. 
Q: People only come from east would try to break it?

Answered: Cain was set to the east.



# `Cain’s psychology, biology and genealogy` Genesis 4

### Genesis 4:1
> Q: `Know his wife` is only meaning `making sex`? 
Or there’s something else more deep meaning in it? 

> Eve got baby because of `God’s help`. 
Q: What’s specific help is it?

### Genesis 4:7
> The `sin’s desire` is contrary to you. 
Q: Sin has desire?

>  “You shall rule over it!” “If you do well...” 
means `Cain didn’t do well on offering`. 
His offering must be less as good as Abel’s, or could be even worse, that he was not offering by will.

### Genesis 4:8
> Q: What did `Cain speak to Abel` before killed him?

### Genesis 4:14
> “Every one finds me...” 
Not specifically says human or animal. 
Most probably beast, because after Adam’s sin, animal start killing too. 
Beasts were all over the place , 
`Cain grew up in protection` had no way to know how to survive from them.

### Genesis 4:17
> That’s the place makes confusion: 
where did this woman come from ?
Answered later on Gen 5:4.

### Genesis 4:17
> He built a city, 
there couldn’t be `Cain’s one family`, 
must be a large group of people already existed there already.



# `Patriarchs from Adam to Noah` Genesis 5
Review [this page on Answer in Genesis: `Ancient patriarchs in genesis`](https://answersingenesis.org/bible-characters/ancient-patriarchs-in-genesis/) for further details.
Interesting part in this chapter is to find out the each one's `life time overlaps` from Adam to Noah,
means Adam could have taught and talked to Noah's father or grandfather Nosh.

### Genesis 5:4
> Adam had many children. 
That solved the problem of where Cain’s wife came from.

> Q: Where was `Adam` living at during his whole life?

### Genesis 5:29
> Surely `Adam died right before Noah’s birth`. 
According to genealogy in this chapter, `Adam certainly could have spoken to Nosh`, who walked with God. 
And Nosh could have directed instruct Noah about everything.

# `Chaos before The Flood` Genesis 6

### Genesis 6:2
> Does `sons of God` refer to Angels? 
Corrupted angles

### Genesis 6:3
> `120 yrs` could be `human's life span` or the `time before The Flood`. 
But in context it’s more likely to indicate `the life span of human`.

### Genesis 6:4
> `Nephilim`, there reason to mention about him here, might be `for researchers only`. 
Just to let you know it’s not a made up story, which might be found evidence in other histories.

> Bingo! `Came in to` is so important here!
Nowhere mentioned the `angel` has `physical body` and could `make love with human`. 
But here it’s clear they `came into`! 
`A spirit` can come into woman and make her pregnant, 
**SAME with** `Holy Spirit` to Marry and bare Jesus. 
But it’s `lower level spirit`: the angel. 
And this can also explain what happened after the `angles fall`. 
That’s why, right after the verse, God said `it’s not good to live too long`.

### Genesis 6:5
> "**EVERY** intention of thoughts of the heart"
Q: How to understand that?

### Genesis 6:6
> Q: How to understand the `regretted` what God said?

### Genesis 6:7
> Q: What is the `face of the land` ?

### Genesis 6:7
> `God is sorry`? 
Q: How could I understand that

### Genesis 6:13
> What Noah was feeling about it when God said so, 
will exactly be the same feeling of `the righteous people in the future when the Judgement is coming`. The `First Judgement` reflects `The second Judgement`, The `First coming` reflects the `Second coming`.

### Genesis 6:15
> God is the `greatest designer`, and of course he’s `good at carpentry`. 
That makes Jesus a good carpenter too. As a son **inherits** his father’s **talent**.

### Genesis 6:17
> It’s clear that only to destroy the` life that can breath`, not including `plants`, `
Single-celled organisms`, and some `sea creatures`.

### Genesis 6:19
> Noah must have the `world’s biggest zoo` ever, and no one could possibly get beyond it . 
Noah must have the `greatest team of hunters` to collect all those animals on earth and in sky. 
But think of how people’s ages were long and knowledge and experiences were accumulated, 
it probably would be easier than we do now. 
And animals **Might Not** be as various as now, since it’s just a few hundreds of years since beginning.

### Genesis 6:22
> Says so easy, but God knows how hard Noah achieve all those missions. 
Each single one might be a `world class challenge`.


# `Coming of the Great Flood` Genesis 7

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/41817050-06b8e5ba-77c6-11e8-878e-17c38e61a041.png)


### Genesis 7:2
> (✔︎) Q: Noah had already had all kinds of animal, what does it mean to take 7 pairs ?
A: It actually can be translated as "7 pairs of each kind", that makes more sense.

### Genesis 7:11
> In regard to this date so detailed , we could easily conduct what exact day did the great Flood came.

> Graph: How did it look like that the window was opened?

### Genesis 7:14
> Research: Since then they’ve got the knowledge of categorise all creatures, what’s the term for that ? Biology?

### Genesis 7:17
> "Rose high above the earth", means the flood was higher than the highest point of any mountain on earth.
Imagine that, no creature would survive in this condition (except some sea creatures). Even bird had no place to land.

### Genesis 7:20
> "`fifteen cubits` deep."
Exact number ! It’s good for researching

### Genesis 7:19
> Probably the waters in the ancient time were not THAT deep like now. But because this Flood, many mountains were still hidden in waters, that human haven’t fully discovered yet

### Genesis 7:21
> Clearly said “sweaming creatures” died, so it even included fish, shark, whales

### Genesis 7:23
> Birds died because nowhere to stand to rest and to eat

### Genesis 7:24
> Stats: How to calculate or stimulate the situation for earth with these number
