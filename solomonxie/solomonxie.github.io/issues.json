先来聊聊万国码：unicode\n\n`万国码unicode`可以被看作当今世界所有文字的统一编码。作为一种基石，不管是什么字只要是保存为unicode就不会错。如果出错，那也只是你选择用什么编码把unicode翻译过来造成的。\n根据维基百科，一个字的unicode的基本表现形式为`“U+”然后紧接着一组十六进制的数字`，也就是`U+hhhh`，其中每一个h代表一个**十六进制**数字。如：`U+4f60`代表中文的'你'，在python里会显示成`u'\\u4f60'`。最前面的'前的u代表后面这串文字是unicode，而`\\u`就是`U+`了，后面的十六进制编码4f60是一样的。\n（坑爹的百度百科，竟然说unicode是二进制，其实UTF才会有二进制-_-）\n\n虽然世界上每个字都有唯一的一个unicode，但是它还分为**编码方式**和**实现方式**。这也就是搞晕python编码的万恶之源了。\n编码方式刚才讲了，就是`U+hhhh`，可实现方式就复杂了：不同操作系统、不同国家的实现方式还都不同。\n维基百科中说：\n\n> Unicode的实现方式不同于编码方式。一个字符的Unicode编码是确定的。但是在实际传输过程中，由于不同系统平台的设计不一定一致，以及出于节省空间的目的，对Unicode编码的实现方式有所不同。\n## 再来聊聊UTF-8\n\n前面说到，unicode的实现方式是在哪都不一样的。这个时候，著名的UTF就出现了：Unicode的实现方式称为**Unicode转换格式**（Unicode Transformation Format，简称为**UTF**）\n而UTF-8就是unicode实现方式中的一种。\n说“实现方式”其实就是“存储方式”\nUTF-8其实仍是一个unicode！仍是一个unicode！仍是一个unicode！重要的话说三遍。\n起初我的印象里unicode、utf-8、gb2312、ansi之流，区别好像只是一个字的不同翻译语言罢了。其实大错！\nUnicode是万国码，utf-8只是unicode的一种实现方式，而gb2312与gbk是中国码，与unicode同级！\n也就是说，**当我们在讨论UTF-8时候，我们是在讨论Unicode**。\n所以当我在维基百科看到这句时，我还以为unicode被新生代取缔了：\n\n> 互联网工程工作小组（IETF）要求所有互联网协议都必须支持UTF-8编码[1]。互联网邮件联盟（IMC）建议所有电子邮件软件都支持UTF-8编码。\n\n说回python来，这也就是为什么我不断换着法地把中文'你好'编译成utf-8输出都显示不出'你好'的原因——因为utf-8本来就显示不出中文来！这句话等同于unicode显示不出中文来。因为他们都只是代号。\n所以，要想显示出中文，就必须找到能把这些代码翻译成中文的“字典”。\n## 曾经那么亲切的GB2312\n\n其实真正用起来，能把unicode翻译出人能看懂的'你好'来的，就只有GB2312系列了。在国内搞工程的都知道，凡是什么前面加`GB`两字，那就是“国(Guo)标(Biao)”了。GB 2312的全称叫`中华人民共和国国家标准简体中文字符集`。\n同理GBK，它的全称叫`汉字内码扩展规范`。拼音就是“国(Guo)标(Biao)扩(Kuo)展”。这样就好理解了。GBK只是一本gb2312的扩展版本。\n凡人来理解的话，GB2312就是一个密码本，或者叫它一本字典。\n## python中字符串'你好'到底是什么格式呢？\n\npython中听到最多的就是，必须通通地用utf-8，这样万无一失。起初我以为，\"你好\"这样的中文，是一种utf-8格式的字符，其实大错特错！\n我们看到的中文，简单说可以归到gb2312或者gbk里面。\n而gb2312或gbk，其实就是一本字典，汉字字典。里面会告诉你`\\u0e24\\u0e43`这个代码，对应的是中文`你`字，`\\u0e1a\\u0e23`对应的是中文`好`字。\n听说utf-8也是一种编码，那它也是一本字典吗？对，它是字典，**但utf-8不是汉语字典！！**\n## 中文字符编码成unicode、utf8和gbk是什么样子呢？\n\n```\n>>> '你好'\n'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'\n>>> uni = '你好'.decode('gb2312')\n>>> uni\nu'\\u4f60\\u597d'\n>>> uni.encode('gb2312')\n```\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/19","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/19/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/19/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/19/events","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/19","id":123169864,"number":19,"title":"Python

我的开发环境是中文win7系统32位， Python 2.7, MySQL 14.4。（Linux在虚拟机里呢，熟练之前先不挑战开发环境了-_-!）\n> 注意：这里是安装python的`mysqldb模块`，而不是mysql, 到了这一步它应该是已经安装好了的（包括`MySQL Server`和`MySQL python connector`）。\n\n**先检查自己是不是已经安装了这个模块**\n极其简单：在Python的命令行中输入`import MySQLdb`，如果没有报错，那就已经安装了。\n## 最简单的安装方法\n\n其实就是随便找个地方按下`win+R`，输入`cmd`回车——打开windows命令行，进行著名的`pip安装大法`：  \n\n> pip install mysql-python\n\n按理来说，这一步足够了。但是我这出现了据说在windows环境下python安装模块的痛：命令行里返回了错误：\n\n> error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat\n\n然后我想到，是不是在windows用`pip`不太合适？所以还是循规蹈矩地到[Python官网下载](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.5#downloads)了MySQLdb的_源文件_，即[MySQL-python-1.2.5.zip](https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/M/MySQL-python/MySQL-python-1.2.5.zip#md5=654f75b302db6ed8dc5a898c625e030c) ([md5](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=show_md5&digest=654f75b302db6ed8dc5a898c625e030c))这个压缩包。\n随便找个地方解压缩，然后以最快的速度在cmd命令行中进入这个目录，输入：\n\n> python setup.py build\n> python setup.py install\n\n按理来说，到这一步就完全成功了。不过，返回的结果是一毛一样的。。。\n\n> error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat\n\n然后我就知道了：其实`pip`安装，和我自己下载源码用`python setup.py build` 、 `python setup.py install`是一样的效果。\n问题源头还是在`vcvarsall.bat`这个东西上。一看文件名就知道是和vc相关。\n查询相关资料，说是[凡是安装和操作系统底层密切相关的Python扩展，几乎都会遇到这个错误。](http://blog.csdn.net/secretx/article/details/17472107)\n经过搜索，绝大多数的回答都是：需要安装`Microsoft

Studio`2008或者2010版本，才能满足Python在windows系统上安装各种底层扩展的需要。\n正在下载2G的VS中。。。\n**不过趁着下载等待时间，我在评论区发现了更easy的方法。。。。**\n![Paste_Image.png](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/841144-983620158389e66d.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n\n打开页面，http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ 是这个模样：\n![Paste_Image.png](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/841144-5af72a9ad43c8d84.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n满屏幕毫无美感的英文，连排版都没有，真有点不太好接受。不过趁着VS还没下载完，就简单读了读，发现了第二行关键词：`University of California, Irvine.`，原来是加大的作品啊，一看就是科学家制作，比较大气，耐着心读了读说明段落——好像是专门针对windows对python支持性差做的工作——把python扩展都制作成了**二进制文件**，即`.whl`文件。\n## 安装二进制的Python扩展包\n\n看起来好像是个好东西，就`ctrl+f`查找mysql，还真找到了！\n\n> MySQL-python, a Python database API 2.0 interface for the MySQL database\n> Mysqlclient is a Python 3 compatible fork of MySQL-python.\n> MySQL_python-1.2.5-cp27-none-win32.whl\n> MySQL_python-1.2.5-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl\n\n选择`win32.whl`这个文件下载，才772k。\n但是这个`whl`文件格式怎么安装呢？回到网页上面，发现说了是用pip安装，于是我在这个目录打开cmd命令行，输入：\n![Paste_Image.png](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/841144-5919730b2cd985f2.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n哈哈，献丑了！`whl`文件的安装方法，在`pip`的官方文档里说明的很清楚([看这里](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#installing-from-wheels))\n所以再来了一遍：\n输入：\n\n> pip install MySQL_python-1.2.5-cp27-none-win32.whl\n> 返回：\n> Processing c:\\tdownload\\mysql\\mysql_python-1.2.5-cp27-none-win32.whl\n> Installing collected packages: MySQL-python\n> Successfully

MySQLdb`，也正常！\n于是乎，我觉得写文章的这个功夫，已经下载好的Microsoft Visual Studio也没必要了。。。。\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/18","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/18/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/18/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/18/events","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/18","id":123169858,"number":18,"title":"Python操作MySQL的中文乱码解决之路","user":{"login":"solomonxie","id":14041622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14041622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-12-20T16:17:01Z","updated_at":"2015-12-20T16:17:01Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"## 第一步：小心翼翼地正常去触碰（连接）数据库\n## 第二步：几个循环读取数据库\n## 第三步：插入英文数据，前方高能：再插入中文数据！\n## 第四步：对网上各种乱码解决方案的测试\n### Solution 1: Python编码的基本设置\n\n``` python\n# coding:utf-8\nimport sys\nreload(sys)\nsys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')\n```\n### Solution 2: 创建数据库连接时指定编码\n\n``` python\ndb = MySQLdb.connect(charset='utf8',host='localhost', db='dbTest', user='root',passwd='000000') \n```\n\n光是这么设置一下，不但中文传不进去，而且还会报错！：\n![Paste_Image.png](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/841144-1ec7d053a6c69ccf.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n所以要配合下面的方法再试一下。\n### Solution 3: 在excute(sql)时传入一个奇妙形式的字符串\n\n``` python\n# 注：这里必须是'utf8'，而不是'utf-8'\ndb = MySQLdb.connect(charset='utf8', host='localhost', db='dbTest', user='root',passwd='000') \ncursor = db.cursor() \nvalues = [u\"中文测试 Unicode, charset='utf8'\"]\nprint value\ncursor.execute('insert into test(txt) values(%s) ', values)\ndb.commit()\ndb.close()\nprint 'OK'\n```\n\n下面是各种情况下成测试：\n- 传入列表的字符串为普通字符串，且设置了charset='utf8'，以及\n- 传入列表的字符串为Unicode字符串，且设置了charset='utf8'，**OK 通过！**\n  ![Paste_Image.png](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/841144-a202021f07d37856.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n- 传入列表的字符串为普通字符串，但**未设置**charset='utf8'：\n  结果**失败！**依然是乱码。\n  ![Paste_Image.png](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/841144-73d8070cfdfa9be6.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n-

总结：也就是说，目前有两个条件是必须的——\n1. 传入excute()第二个参数，必须是`list`列表变量\n2. connect()构造函数中，必须设置`charset='utf8'`\n### Solution 4: 在Python里面给MySQL数据库设定编码\n\n代码如下：\n\n``` python\ncursor = db.cursor() \ncursor.execute(\"SET NAMES 'utf8'\") \ncursor.execute(\"SET CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT=utf8\") \ncursor.execute(\"SET CHARACTER_SET_RESULTS=utf8\")\n# OK 测试成功\ncursor.execute('insert into test(txt) values(\"我是中文\") ') \n# OK 第二次不写以上三条也通过\n# cursor.execute('insert into test(txt) values(\"我是中文2，看看会不会保存设置。\") ') \n# Failed 无论怎么玩，charset=不设置就不通过\n# cursor.execute('insert into test(txt) values(\"我是中文3，看看不带charset=管不管用。\") ') \n# cursor.execute('insert into test(txt) values(\"我是中文4\") ') # OK 测试成功\ncursor.execute('insert into test(txt) values(\"我是中文5，看看重新打开mysql终端，还会不会保留设置。\") ') # OK 测试成功\ndb.commit()\ndb.close()\n```\n\n具体情况是：\n![Paste_Image.png](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/841144-ae37a740b8167731.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n![Paste_Image.png](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/841144-adae3e7d2d2a9267.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n#### 也就是说：这种方法也必须有2个条件：\n1. connect()构造函数中，必须设置charset='utf8'\n2. 必须显示地写三句excute语句，来设置MySQL端的编码\n\n只要遵守这2个条件，\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/17","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/17/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/17/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/17/events","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/17","id":122260610,"number":17,"title":"58招聘数据爬取准备:

招聘搜索页源码分析\n\n下面是我将几乎全部搜索条件都加上的全链接：\n*http://bj.58.com/haidian/tech/pve_5363_244_pve_5754_1476_pve_5356_6_pve_5357_6/?key=%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE&minxinzi=3000_4999&postdate=20151209_20151216&param6693=8&PGTID=0d303655-0047-792b-50b1-e40ba04c7e85&ClickID=1 *\n好的，根据这个链接，以及各种尝试出来的判断，URL的结论如下：\n- 第一部分：子域名。`bj.58.com`，其中`bj`作为城市范围的“参数值”。值得一提的是，58同城没有省级分区，全都是针对某个城市。\n- 第二部分：目录参数。以下按目录**固定顺序**排列：\n  1. `/haidian/`即海淀区，代表了地区或地点“参数值”，还可以是`/wudaokou/`五道口、`/beijingdaxue/`北京大学等，还可以是`/beijingzhoubian/`北京周边，都是区域那一栏所有选项的中文全拼。**如果是现实全北京的数据的话，这个目录参数是被省略的的**。\n  2. `/tech/`即职位类别为\"计算机/互联网\"类。这一部分有点意思，如果改成`/job/`就会不限分类，显示所有结果；如果改成`/chengxuyuan/`则会显示\"程序员\"的子职业分类。也就是说，58不区分各种职业的层级关系，**也不考虑多选**——要么全选要么单选。\n  3. `pve_5363_244_pve_5754_1476_pve_5356_6_pve_5357_6` 这个是看起来最复杂的，但是稍微留意下也好理解，其实是——“更多”栏的筛选项，一般有四种参数在这里显示，每种之间用下划线连接，如果没有选择的话这里就不显示其值。其中`pve_$$$$_??`是固定格式，$$$$是4位数字代表参数名，后面的`??`是1~4位是不固定的数字代表参数值。\n     - pve_5363：公司行业代号。后面的244是“计算机/互联网行业”。合在一起代表“公司行业为计算机及互联网行业”。\n     - pve_5754：公司性质代号。后面的1476代表“私营”企业。\n     - pve_5356：学历要求代号。后面的6代表“本科”。\n     - pve_5357：经验要求代号。后面的6代表“3年-5年”。\n- 第三部分：查询参数。这里就没有固定顺序了。\n  - params6693：福利待遇。如果值是`1`，代表五险一金；`6`代表周末双休。**不可多选！**\n  - minixinzi：薪资范围。如`0_999`及`3000_4999`等。\n## 页码：\n\n页码超出搜索结果的总页码时，会显示省略号。\n但是结果再多，也只能显示到70页，和智联招聘差不多（到90页）。\n## 包含招聘结果的大框架\n\n页面唯一重要的列表信息，都包括在了这个框架中：\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"infolist\" class=\"tablist cleft\" tongji_id=\"ZP_job_list_div_items\">\n    <dl

a[class=\"next\"]`，获取其`href`属性值就好了。如果没有，表示正在最后一页。\n- 当前页码：`div[class=\"pagerout\"] div[class=\"pager\"] strong`，当前页是不带链接的，所以要这样获取。\n### 判断搜索结果是否读完\n\n通过测试发现，根据结果数量的不同，除了正常外汇产生以下结果：\n1. 显示`新信息较少，我们为您推荐以下相关信息：`一般是因为超过了应有的页码了。这样的信息通过源码找到`<dt class=\"shortMsg\">新信息较少，我们为您推荐以下相关信息：</dt>`就可以了。\n2. 显示`很抱歉，没有找到符合已选条件的信息。\\n建议您：`，这是因为搜索条件太苛刻没有符合条件的。这样的，通过源码找到：\n\n``` html\n<i class=\"ico report\"></i><p>很抱歉，没有找到符合已选条件的信息。<br />建议您：</p>\n```\n# 招聘详细页源码分析\n\n这个页面比较简单，除了企业联系方式是动态加载的图片外都比较好定位抓取。不过联系方式也对我没什么太大用就不费那功夫了。\n## 精简招聘信息\n\n是被包含在头文件中用来给搜索引擎搜索用的，所以是精华中的精华哈哈。如下：\n\n``` html\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"[最新招聘信息]诚聘诚聘数据分析师5000+1人,工作地点位于北京海淀中关村,公司规模100-499人,薪资待遇5000-8000元,工作经验1-2年,学历要求大专,招聘岗位职责： 建立公司数据分析的系统，组织数据分析报表的整合和规范、优化； 建立公司数据管理、查询的各项规章制度； 建立公司每日、周、月、季、年度数据分析报表模板； 研究数据分析的方法，做到报表制作, 100)\" />\n```\n\n只要通过`<meta name=\"description\"`定位，获取其`content`属性值`就好了。\n## 获取招聘基本信息\n\n所有的信息都包含在了`<div class=\"wb-main\">...</div>`框架中。能够找到的信息如下：\n1. 职位名称：\n- 更新时间：\n- 浏览人数和投递人数：这个略过，没什么用。\n- 企业名称及链接：都在`<a class=\"companyName\" >`，直接获取`href`就行了。\n- 营业执照是否已经过验证：`<div class=\"vip-yan fl\"><span title=\"营业执照已验证\" class=\"licIcon\"></span>营业执照已认证</div>`。找到`<div class=\"vip-yan fl\">`就好了。\n- 所在行业、企业性质、企业规模和登记时间都在这里了：\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"compMsg clearfix\">\n    <ul>\n        <li>\n            <span>行业：</span>\n            <a href=\"http://qy.58.com/bj_264/\" target=\"_blank\" >广告/创意</a>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <span>性质： </span>私营\n        </li>\n        <li class=\"scale\">\n            <span>规模： </span>100-499人\n        </li>\n        <li class=\"joinday\" style=\"display: none;\">\n            <span>入驻时长：</span>174天\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\n写累了，直接上BeautifulSoup格式的css选择器的查找语法，分别为：\n所在行业 =`div[class*=compMsg] ul li a[href]`找到，\n企业性质 = `div[class*=compMsg] ul li nth-of-type(2)`,\n企业规模 = `div[class*=compMsg] ul li nth-of-type(3)`或者`li[class=\"scale\"]`, \n入驻时间 = `div[class*=compMsg] ul li nth-of-type(4)`或`li[class=\"joinday\"]`。\n## 获取联系信息\n\n都包含在这个div中：\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"contact mt25\" id=\"lianxi\" tongji_id=\"ZP_job_detail_div_contact\">...</div>\n```\n\n然后可以找到这些信息：\n1. 联系人：`<span class=\"conTip\">王经理 <span>(联系我时请说明是在58同城上看到的)</span></span>`，定位方法：`div[class=\"conTip\"]`。\n- 工作地点：源码有点长，定位方法：只能用文字匹配了，找到`<dt>工作地址：</dt>`和`<span class=\"area\">`这2个标签，它们\n  中间的标签就是地址。\n- 卫星定位：其实也不用费劲，直接找到`a[class=\"map\"]`，获取其`href`然后用增则表达式匹配2个`116.337795`这种数字，就得到精确坐标了。源码如下：\n\n``` html\n<a class=\"map\" href=\"javascript:setbg('诚聘数据分析师',430,240,'http://qy.58.com/mapdetail.html?lat=116.337795%2C39.977523&name=%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E5%9C%B0%E7%82%B9');\"><i></i>查看地图</a>\n```\n## 获取企业介绍\n\n企业信息都包含在这里面：\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"compIntro\" id=\"gongsi\">...</div>\n```\n\n定位方式为：直接`div[class=\"compIntro\"]`或`#gongsi`获取所有文字内容就是企业介绍了。\n# 企业主页源码分析\n\n58还真是方便，再牛的企业都是一模一样的简单网页。不过还好，这也方便获取数据了。\n这个页面极其简单，但是有一点需要注意，数据是用表格动态呈现的，每种信息的位置并不固定，是根据企业有没有这个信息才显示出来的。所以在信息定位上，尽量避免用序号，只能用中文匹配了。。需要获取的数据如下：\n1. 卫星定位：在头文件中，如`<meta name=\"location\" content=\"province=北京;city=北京; coord=116.404,39.915\">`。找到`<meta name=\"location\" />`获取`coord`属性值就好了。\n- 企业名称及ID：`div[class=\"compT\"] a[href]`就可以找到企业名称，在`href`属性中的是`/ID/`这样的格式，去掉`/`就好了。\n- 企业资质：最好在`div[class=\"basicMsg\"] tr`中用文字匹配。\n- 企业性质：最好在`div[class=\"basicMsg\"] tr`中用文字匹配。\n- 企业行业：最好在`div[class=\"basicMsg\"] tr`中用文字匹配。\n- 企业规模：最好在`div[class=\"basicMsg\"] tr`中用文字匹配。\n- 联系人：  最好在`div[class=\"basicMsg\"] tr`中用文字匹配。\n- 联系电话：用文字匹配或`[class=\"telNum\"] img`，注意，联系电话都是图片格式的，而且可以不止一个！（省事的话就别下载图片了，保存链接就好了，因为图片来源明显不是静态图片而是服务器动态生成的。）\n- 企业网址（自己的）：最好在`div[class=\"basicMsg\"] tr a`中或用文字匹配。\n- 企业邮箱：和电话一样，用文字匹配或`[class=\"telNum\"] img`来找图片。\n- 公司地址：最好在`div[class=\"basicMsg\"] tr`中用文字匹配。\n# 企业信用档案页面URL及源码分析\n\n这个页面不知道入口在哪里？偶然看到的，然后心里大呼——哇塞！哈哈\n虽然找不到入口或者查询页面，但是发现其实看懂URL就很简单了，必要格式如下：\n`http://credit.vip.58.com/usercredit?userId=企业ID`\n那么这时候刚才获取的企业ID就起作用了。手工输入了一下，ID对的话每家企业都能出来。\n建立了档案的企业——会显示巨详细的信息！连法人代表、注册资本、详细地址全都有。\n没建立档案的企业——也会显示页面，但信息处全都是空白。\n下面就简单分析下基本信息的获取。\n## 获取企业营业执照信息\n\n表格基本上是固定位置的，因为大家营业执照都一样嘛哈哈~\n首先获取信息框架：`div[class=\"zzxx_ta\"] table`，然后再到这个框架里操作，就简单多了。\n下面是信息定位分析：\n1. 公司名称：`td[class=\"tdbg\"] + td`的第1项或`span[class=\"headTitle\"]`\n- 注册号：`td[class=\"tdbg\"] + td`的第2项\n- 经营地址：`td[class=\"tdbg\"] + td`的第3项\n- 注册资本：`td[class=\"tdbg\"] + td`的第4项\n- 成立日期：`td[class=\"tdbg\"] + td`的第5项\n- 法定代表人：`td[class=\"tdbg\"] + td`第6项\n- 登记机关：`td[class=\"tdbg\"] + td`的第7项\n- 企业类型：`td[class=\"tdbg\"] + td`的第8项\n- 营业期限：`td[class=\"tdbg\"] + td`的第9项\n- 核准日期：`td[class=\"tdbg\"] + td`的第10项\n- 登记状态：`td[class=\"tdbg\"] + td`的第11项\n- 在营（开业）企业：`td[class=\"tdbg\"] + td`的第12项\n- 经营范围：`td[class=\"tdbg\"] + td`的第13项\n## 获取企业其他信息\n1. 企业简介：`div[class=\"briefIntro\"]`\n2. 企业图片：`div[class=\"albumBox\"] img`\n3. 企业抽查检查信息：`div[class=\"zzxx_ta\"] nth-of-type(1) tr`，如果有记录则显示，无记录则只显示一条“无xx信息”。可以适当排除。\n4. 企业经营异常信息：`div[class=\"zzxx_ta\"] nth-of-type(2) tr`，如果有记录则显示，无记录则只显示一条“无xx信息”。可以适当排除。\n5. 企业行政处罚信息：`div[class=\"zzxx_ta\"] nth-of-type(3) tr`，如果有记录则显示，无记录则只显示一条“无xx信息”。可以适当排除。\n6. 企业严重违法信息：`div[class=\"zzxx_ta\"] nth-of-type(4) tr`，如果有记录则显示，无记录则只显示一条“无xx信息”。可以适当排除。\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/15","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/15/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/15/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/15/events","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/15","id":121911820,"number":15,"title":"智联招聘数据爬取准备(3)-企业主页源码解析","user":{"login":"solomonxie","id":14041622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14041622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":290633688,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-12-13T10:27:22Z","updated_at":"2015-12-13T10:27:22Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"# 网页源码解析 - 智联招聘 企业主页\n\n智联招聘的企业主页分为2种：标准主页和Special主页。Special主页是智联招聘里唯一能够让企业自己定制的页面了。\n这也就形成了千奇百怪的源码，分析起来并不容易。不过好在企业的基本信息，在招聘页面就已经获得了。\n剩下唯一需要的信息就是企业的`所有招聘信息`了，也是非常重要的地方。\n招聘信息在2种不同主页中，在源码中也分为了2种构建方式：\n- 标准主页   ：正常的tag循环陈列。域名统一是`http://special.zhaopin.com/`这样的\n- Special主页：在javascript中以list列表变量形式储存，并动态显示出来。域名统一是`http://company.zhaopin.com/`这样的。\n## 隐藏的“标准主页”\n\n在研究Special主页源码中，有很大的不确定性。不过索性发现了一个“好玩的”东西：\n\n``` html\n<td align=\"right\"><!--<a href=\"http://company.zhaopin.com/CC252448519.htm\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#ffffff;\">招聘职位标准页面</a>-->&nbsp;</td>\n```\n\n其中链接和内容是被注释掉的，增加了获取的难度。不顾BeautifulSoup还是可以搜到它的，作为Comment对象存在。\n#### 这意味着什么？那就意味着——每个自定义的主页，实际上还是存在着一个“标准版”主页的，那样就容易解析了。\n## 企业ID获取\n\n其实也没什么大作用，不过如果方便获取，拿到它也是不错的，因为毕竟是一家企业在智联的数据库中唯一的标识吗！\n通过观察，企业ID在企业主页的URL、源码中都频频出现：例如A公司的ID是`121017111`在URL中有时是`CC1210/1711/`，有时是`CC121017111.htm`，有时是`1210171119251740.htm`，还有`pagepublish/12101711/index.html`这样的。而在源码中经常会在Javascript脚本中出现，如`CC121017111J90251741000`这样的或是`CC121017111J90250035000_530_1`这样的。\n首先可以确定的是，企业ID一般是**9位纯数字**组成。\n如上面URL中的如果以ID作为目录名则会时而减去最后1位变成8位，暂时不知道为什么，也许他们的目录必须在8位以下吧。\n下面就来解析一下几种已知的出现方式和获取方式。\n### 标准主页中的企业ID：\n- 网址是`http://company.zhaopin.com/CC220397616.htm`的\n  1. 在URL中就可以获取ID，去掉`CC`和文件扩展名即是9位的ID`220397616`。\n  2. 最直接的，脚本中会找到`<input type=\"hidden\" value=\"CC220397616\" id=\"companyNumber\" />`这样的代码，直接可以通过`id=\"companyNumber\"`找到企业ID。\n  3. 在JS脚本中可以看到`var arrVarFromASP = ['CC220397616'];`这样的变量。\n  4. 在JS脚本中可以看到这样的链接跳转：\n  \n  ``` html\n  <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"applyjob('CC220397616J90250044000_530_1_66_101__2_');return false;\" class=\"applyJob\">申请职位</a>\n  <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" onclick=\"saveJobTerminalApply('CC220397616J90250044000_530_1'); return false;\" class=\"collectJob\">收藏职位</a>\n  ```\n  \n  ```\n  可以发现，`CC220397616J90250044000_530_1_66_101__2_`无论多长，企业ID总是`CC`的9位数字，而从`J`开头，就是具体的**职位ID**了。\n  ```\n  1. 源码中有`<a href=\"http://sou.zhaopin.com/jobs/companysearch.ashx?CompID=CC220397616\">公司内搜索</a>`会发现这样的链接标签，参数`CompID`即是。\n  2. 源码中有`<a href=\"http://jobs.zhaopin.com/220397616250038.htm\" target=\"_blank\">【全职】助理分析师 可即刻上崗</a>`这样的链接表情，在文件名`220397616250038.htm`中，前9位是企业ID，后6位`250038`为职位ID。\n  3. \n### Special主页中的企业ID：\n\nSpecial主页中确定的信息并不多，唯一确定会出现企业ID的就是招聘链接的URL中了：\n\n``` html\n<a href=\"http://jobs.zhaopin.com/286304915250270.htm?ssidkey=y&ff=02&ss=101\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"实习生（长期招聘）\">实习生（长期招聘）</a>\n```\n\n将URL中的文件名获取，并得到前9位数字就是了。\n\n获取完标准页面链接后，就可以开始解析了。因为标准页面的链接也不一定能获取到，所以Special页面的分析也简单看一看。\n以下为两种企业主页的源码分析。\n## 标准企业主页\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"part4 positionList\" id=\"morecity\">\n<h3>\n    <span class=\"jobNameT\">职位名称</span>\n    <span class=\"comNameT\">公司名称</span>\n    <span class=\"jobPayT\">职位月薪</span>\n    <span class=\"jobAddrT\">工作地点</span>\n    <span class=\"publishTimeT\">发布日期</span>\n</h3>\n<!--1个职位详情对应一个类名为positionListContent的div-->\n<div class=\"positionListContent\" id=\"positionlist_530\">\n\n    <div class=\"positionListContent1\">\n        <span class=\"jobName\"><a href=\"http://jobs.zhaopin.com/552256928252361.htm\" target=\"_blank\">数据库工程师</a></span>\n        <span class=\"comName\">民信阿里信息咨询(北京)有限公司</span>\n        <span class=\"jobPay\">15001-20000元</span>\n        <span class=\"jobAddr\">北京</span>\n        <span class=\"publishTime\">2015-12-12</span>\n        <div class=\"clearFloat\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"cLeft\">\n        <span>地点：北京</span>\n        <span>公司性质：民营</span>\n        <span>公司规模：1000-9999人</span>\n        <span>经验：3-5年</span>\n        <span>学历：本科</span>\n        <span>职位月薪：15001-20000元</span>\n        <p>\n             岗位职责：   1、公司核心数据库的管理，保证数据库正常运转和数据的安全；包括安装、配置、升级，数据备份、恢复，性能监控分析调优等； 2、参与开发设计，负责数据结构设计； 3、负责公司数据仓库的建设。     任职要求：   1、具有三年以上MySQL工作经验； 2、精通MySQL数据库的运行机制和体系架构； 3、精...\n        </p>\n
