How to calculate the ratio of an `direction angle`\r\n> `direction angle` is a term for vectors. It is the angle we care about for a vector, which is in between of the vector line and the positive side of axis-x.\r\n\r\n**The ratio of a `direction angle` is always drawn from the positive side of axis-x, so that you could know what direction is this vector going to.**\r\n\r\nFor a vector we only know its x-distance and y-distance, so in terms of trigonometry, or in `right triangle`, they're `Opposite` and `Adjacent`.  So that we could use `Tangent` to calculate the ratio, such as `tan⁻¹(y/x)`.\r\n\r\n**But the thing is**, `tan⁻¹(...)` always gives you a number less then 90. So we have to do some tricks for doing this when the direction angle's ratio of a vector is greater than 90, or lesser 0.\r\n\r\nTo classify those situations, we use the idea of `4 quadrant` of the axis system.\r\n\r\n> And once we see x and y, we could immediately identify which quadrant the vector will fall into, then use the different method to calculte as follow:\r\n\r\n### [1st Quadrant ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (+x, +y):\r\n```\r\nRatio = tan⁻¹(y/x)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![snip20180227_91](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36723018-1758cbf2-1bea-11e8-88dd-ae3753bbe2db.png)\r\n\r\n### [2nd Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (-x, +y):\r\n```\r\nRatio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 180\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36723008-12b4d618-1bea-11e8-988e-840d942b66a0.png)\r\n\r\n### [3rd Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/more-examples-finding-vector-angles) (-x, -y):\r\n```\r\nRatio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 180\r\n```\r\n\r\n![snip20180227_89](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36722966-f68032ee-1be9-11e8-808e-c623a3c248da.png)\r\n\r\n### [4th Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/more-examples-finding-vector-angles) (x, -y):\r\n```\r\nRatio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 360\r\n```\r\n\r\n![snip20180227_90](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36722956-eee1defc-1be9-11e8-9dcc-ab3c935afa48.png)\r\n\r\n"}]
