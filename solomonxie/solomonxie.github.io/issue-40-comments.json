Other than two vectors, are all **`REDUNDANT`**. \r\nIn another word:\r\n**IF ANY TWO VECTORS ARE INDEPENDENT, THEN OTHERS ARE ALL DEPENDENT.**\r\n\r\n### How to know whether a linear combination is dependent\r\n\r\n[Refer to Khan lecture: Span and linear independence example](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/linear-independence/v/span-and-linear-independence-example)\r\n\r\nA `linear combination` is **dependent**, **iff** it could satisfy this equation:\r\n```py\r\nc₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + c₃v₃ .... = 0\r\n```\r\n`c..` means the scalar for each vector, and you could change the scalar to any number, positive or negative.\r\nNote that: `c ≠ 0`, and vectors are not all zeros.\r\n\r\nAssume that there's a linear combination of two vectors `v₁ + v₂ + v₃`, \r\nwith scalars it could be `c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + c₃v₃`.\r\nTo verify whether it's dependent or independent, \r\nwe assume `c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + c₃v₃= (0,0,0)` and solve for `c₁, c₂, c₃`:\r\n- it's **independent** <=> if `c₁ = c₂ = c₃ = 0` **all** are zeros\r\n- it's **dependent** <=> If `c₁, c₂, c₃` **at least one** is NON-ZERO number\r\n\r\nExample 1: `Is vectors (2,1) and (3,2) dependent or independent?`\r\nSolve:\r\n- Assume `c₁(2,1) + c₂(3,2) = (0,0)`\r\n- Get system of equations:\r\n    - `2c₁ + 3c₂ = 0`\r\n    - `1c₁ + 2c₂ = 0`\r\n- Solve system of equations get: `c₁=c₂=0`\r\n- So it's a **independent linear combination**.\r\n\r\nExample 2: `Is vectors (1,-1,2), (1,1,3) and (-1,0,2) dependent or independent?`\r\n- Assume `c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + c₃v₃= (0,0,0)`\r\n- get the system of equations of 3 unknowns `c₁, c₂, c₃`\r\n- solve equations get solutions get `c₁ = c₂ = c₃ = 0`\r\n- So they're **independent**."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/comments/380087636","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40#issuecomment-380087636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40","id":380087636,"user":{"login":"solomonxie","id":14041622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14041622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T12:54:07Z","updated_at":"2018-04-18T07:12:02Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"# `Vectors multiplication`\r\n> Vector multiplication is FUNDAMENTAL skill to solve `Matrices multiplication`.\r\n\r\n**THE VERY FIRST THING TO DO WITH A `VECTOR MULTIPLICATION` OR `MATRIX MULTIPLICATION`, IS TO FORGET EVERYTHING ABOUT `ARITHMETIC MULTIPLICATION` !!**\r\nOTHERWISE, YOU WILL FALL INTO AN ENDLESS CONFUSION!\r\n\r\nJust to know, multiplication of vectors or matrices, **AREN'T** really multiplication, but just look like that.

by Gilbert Strang: 1.2_.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38916654-ccbf081a-431a-11e8-8ecc-d84d01dfcdc2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Understand Dot product in physics`\r\n> It makes lots more sense to think `dot product` in **physics** way than maths algebraic way.\r\n\r\n**Just to think `Two forces` \"a & b\" are `pulling` a box,** \r\nso how much power did it pulled on the `direction of a`, or how much on the `direction of b`?\r\n\r\n### `Vectors on same direction`\r\nLet's make it easier before digging in:\r\nassume there's no angle, `Two forces` \"a & b\" are `pulling` to the same way, the same direction,\r\nso how much power would it be pulled?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38633159-62e797d2-3df1-11e8-8e6e-b7600a0b7d32.png)\r\nWell, the force `a & b` working together, it's a process of **`Boosting`** the energy! \r\n**It's not ADDING together anymore**, it's `BOOSTING`!\r\nLet's say the force `a` has `3 units` power, `b` has `6 units` power. \r\nSo every `1 unit` power `a` pulls, `b` will pull `2 units` power.\r\nThen it make sense:\r\nThe total power pulling the thing would be `3 · 6 = 18 units`\r\n\r\n### `Vectors on different direction`\r\nSo the `Two forces` AREN'T pulling the box at the same direction anymore, how much power did it pulled on the `direction of a`, or how much on the `direction of b`?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38632862-91a762ce-3df0-11e8-9545-1e19ed677936.png)\r\n![screencast 2018-04-12 15-13-15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38661687-4d62303e-3e64-11e8-9529-78cc511f52c1.gif)\r\n\r\nLet's think about how much power it's pulling on the direction of `b`.\r\nSince `a` is pulling on a bit **wrong way**, so **`a`'s power ISN'T 100% working on `b`'s way**.\r\nHow much power left there?\r\nIt depends on the angle.\r\nSo to calculate how much left, we use `|a| × cos(θ)`, \r\nand we got a **PROJECTION** or a reflection or a **shadow** of `a` on `b`! \r\nThen it become like this picture again:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38633159-62e797d2-3df1-11e8-8e6e-b7600a0b7d32.png)\r\nHow amazing it is!\r\nAnd now we could **Boost** the power on b: `|b| ×  |a|×cosθ`\r\n\r\n## `Ways of calculating dot product`\r\n\r\nThere're two ways to calculate the dot product (I made up the names):\r\n- Shadow Boost: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38635179-24867f34-3df7-11e8-8571-ba6fa706aa3f.png)\r\n- Axes Boost: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38635195-2b519c04-3df7-11e8-8a73-34171669a673.png)\r\n\r\nResult of two ways are **SAME**.\r\n\r\n> Remember: Boosting is not working when two vectors are **Perpendicular**, which product is `0`.\r\n\r\n### `Shadow Boost`\r\n> We reflect one vector on another one, then **Boost** the energy.\r\n\r\nIntuition:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38634997-a69cff08-3df6-11e8-98b4-a66c2e0c1156.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### `Axes Boost`\r\n> We break two vectors to `X-axis` and `Y-axis`, and BOOST on each axis.\r\n\r\nEasier to remember the formula is:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38634475-2a08a182-3df5-11e8-989e-11218ff847f8.png)\r\n\r\nIntuition:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38635041-bf54e088-3df6-11e8-9562-3f18002d288e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Matrix-matrix product\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Understand Matrix multiplication`\r\nThere're so many different ways to understand it, to make sense of it, because it's so hard to understand.\r\n\r\nThe major fond of ways to understand are:\r\n- Through `Matrix transformation`\r\n- Through `Real-life example`\r\n- ~Through Algebraic methods~\r\n\r\nAlthough `Real-life example` makes sense easily, but it aren't gonna help solving problems well.\r\nSo `Matrix transformation` is the ultimate way to understand Matrix multiplications.\r\nAnd it proved that it is the best way for that, and for all core ideas of `Linear Algebra`.\r\n\r\nBefore we start, let's make things clear:\r\n- Dot product: Vector * Vector\r\n- Matrix-vector product: Matrix * Vector\r\n- Matrix-Matrix product: Matrix * Matrix\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38662516-29af0b78-3e67-11e8-997c-63760193eba9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to Khan lecture video: [Matrix vector products as linear transformations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations/linear-transformations/v/matrix-vector-products-as-linear-transformations)\r\n\r\n> In the GPU of a computer,\r\n**\"ALL THE GRAPHIC PROCESSORS ARE JUST HARD-WIRED MATRIX MULTIPLIERS! ALL THEY DO IS JUST MULTIPLYING MATRICES!\" - SAL KHAN**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# `Linear transformation`\r\n> There're so many different ways to understand Matrix Multiplications, \r\nand **Linear Transformations** is the best and probably the only one makes sense and perfect intuition to you, i.e. it might be the only chance to understand it after all.\r\n\r\n**LINEAR TRANSFORMATION IS THE VERY KEY TO OPEN UP ALL GETES IN LINEAR ALGEBRA, BECAUSE IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE OF MATRIX MULTIPLICATION.**\r\n\r\nTo understand `matrix multiplication`, Linear Transformation is the very first thing you want to learn. It's fairly important and can't get away with.\r\n\r\n> `Linear transformation` is a special kind of Transformation, which deals with `vectors`.\r\n\r\nNeed to mention that, 3Blue1Brown has done well on build intuition on this topic:\r\nRefer to 3Blue1Brown's video: [Linear transformations and matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=4)\r\nRefer to the same video: [How does linear transformation work on unit vectors](https://youtu.be/kYB8IZa5AuE?t=3m47s)\r\nRefer to 3Blue1Brown's video: [Three-dimensional linear transformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHLEWRxRGiM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=6)\r\nRefer to 3Blue1Brown's video: [Matrix multiplication as composition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkY2DOUCWMU&index=5&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)\r\n\r\n\r\n> \"Matrices give us  **a language** to describe these transformations, where the columns represent those coordinates. \r\nAnd matrix-vector multiplication is just a way to compute what that transformation does to a given vector. \r\nEvery time you see a matrix, you can interpret it as a certain transformation of space. \r\nOnce you digest the idea, you’re in a great position to understand the linear algebra deeply. \r\n**Almost all of the topics in linear algebra will become easy to understand once you start thinking about matrices as transformations of space.**\" - 3Blue1Brown\r\n\r\n\r\n**YOU JUST HAVE TO MEMORISE THIS EQUATION AND GET THE IDEA. THAT IS GONNA HELP YOU OUT FROM ALL THE IDEAS AND PROBLEMS IN LINEAR ALGEBRA.**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38699787-a0232910-3ecb-11e8-844e-30ccf58a5500.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Change the basis`\r\n> `Changing basis` is the very core of Linear Transformation. Every single move is based on this.\r\n\r\nRemember a vector `(a, b)` could also present in `unit vector` form as `v = ai + bj`,\r\nand unit vectors are `i = (1, 0) & j = (0, 1)`.\r\n\r\nIf we want to transform a vector, like `move, flip, rotate, scale`, the thing we'll do is:\r\n**TO CHANGE THE UNIT VECTOR `i` AND `j`**.\r\n\r\nFor example, there's a vector `v = (-1, 2)`, and it can present as `v = -1i + 2j`, then we're to do some movement to it:\r\n- Move: We let unit vector `i = (100, 0)`, then the vector moves to the right becomes `(-100, 2)`.\r\n- Rotate: we let unit vector `i = (0, 1)` and `j = (-1, 0)`, then the vector rotates 90° becomes `(-2, -1)`.\r\n**THAT'S THE MAGIC!!**\r\n\r\nBy telling where the `unit vectors` are to go, we can create a pattern, a mapping rule, so that every vector uses this map, this rule, this pattern will have the same transformation!\r\n\r\nAnother example: \r\nAssume there's a vector `v=(5,7)`, and let the unit vector `i=(3,-2)` and `j=(2,1)`, and present this **`TRANSFORM PATTERN`** as below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38697466-ae386936-3ec4-11e8-82b8-b88130a4906b.png)\r\n\r\nAnd we present this `Applying a transformation to a vector` in the form below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38697449-9b20935a-3ec4-11e8-917a-342a23259eec.png)\r\n\r\n**SO WHENEVER YOU ENCOUNTER MATRIX MULTIPLICATION AGAIN, NEVER READ IT AS TWO VECTORS OR TWO MATRICES MULTIPLYING TOGETHER!**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## `How to interpret a Matrix Multiplication`\r\n\r\nThere're only TWO part of this matrix multiplication:\r\n- `The Graph`: the 1st on right item.\r\n- `The Rules`: All the rest Matrices on the left of `The Graph`.\r\n\r\n`The Graph` could be one point (vector) or many points (vectors), e.g.:\r\n- A point: `(2,3)`\r\n- A triangle: `[ (3,0)   (0,4)   (3,4) ]`\r\n- A rectangle: `[ (3,0)   (3,4)    (0,4)  (0,0)]`\r\n- Any shape in any dimension.....\r\n\r\nSO ALL YOU NEED TO DO, IS JUST TO APPLY THOSE RULES ONE BY ONE, `LEFT BY RIGHT`, AND GET A NEW GRAPH!!!\r\n\r\nFor example, we apply two transform rules to a vector `(x, y)`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38699596-0936739a-3ecb-11e8-93ea-8fdd79af23e4.png)\r\n\r\nIt's exactly same with the function principles: `Shear( Rotate(x, y) )`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38699833-cb3ac450-3ecb-11e8-8364-bb1540ab33ae.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Break up the Matrices with its Geometric meaning`\r\n\r\nIn the `transform rule` as below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38698610-39ec988c-3ec8-11e8-9fac-759fe64ff376.png)\r\n\r\n**WE HAVE TO BREAK THE MATRICES INTO SINGLE PARTS BEFORE WE DO THE CALCULATION.** \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38698753-b2b7801a-3ec8-11e8-843b-3431c4955d46.png)\r\n\r\nAnd since we made the rule for `i & j`, so let's apply the `unit vector` to `the Graph`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38698988-632deb46-3ec9-11e8-9fd1-5edfef552f0f.png)\r\n\r\nNote that: \r\n- The original graph is `v = 5i + 7j`, so after applying the new rule of `i & j`, we get: \r\n`v = 5(3,-2) + 7(2,1)`\r\n- And now we could do the `Vector multiply a scalar` method, to get this:\r\n`v = (15,-10) + (14,7)`\r\n- Then we could do `Add two vectors`:\r\n`v = (19, -3)`\r\n- So after applying the transformation rule, we successfully transformed the vector to a new position:\r\n `(19, -3)`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/comments/381069038","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40#issuecomment-381069038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40","id":381069038,"user":{"login":"solomonxie","id":14041622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14041622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-13T08:48:21Z","updated_at":"2018-04-13T08:55:30Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#
