product` in **physics** way than maths algebraic way.\r\n\r\n**Just to think `Two forces` \"a & b\" are `pulling` a box,** \r\nso how much power did it pulled on the `direction of a`, or how much on the `direction of b`?\r\n\r\n#### `Vectors on same direction`\r\nLet's make it easier before digging in:\r\nassume there's no angle, `Two forces` \"a & b\" are `pulling` to the same way, the same direction,\r\nso how much power would it be pulled?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38633159-62e797d2-3df1-11e8-8e6e-b7600a0b7d32.png)\r\nWell, the force `a & b` working together, it's a process of **`Boosting`** the energy! \r\n**It's not ADDING together anymore**, it's `BOOSTING`!\r\nLet's say the force `a` has `3 units` power, `b` has `6 units` power. \r\nSo every `1 unit` power `a` pulls, `b` will pull `2 units` power.\r\nThen it make sense:\r\nThe total power pulling the thing would be `3 · 6 = 18 units`\r\n\r\n#### `Vectors on different direction`\r\nSo the `Two forces` AREN'T pulling the box at the same direction anymore, how much power did it pulled on the `direction of a`, or how much on the `direction of b`?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38632862-91a762ce-3df0-11e8-9545-1e19ed677936.png)\r\n![screencast 2018-04-12 15-13-15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38661687-4d62303e-3e64-11e8-9529-78cc511f52c1.gif)\r\n\r\nLet's think about how much power it's pulling on the direction of `b`.\r\nSince `a` is pulling on a bit **wrong way**, so **`a`'s power ISN'T 100% working on `b`'s way**.\r\nHow much power left there?\r\nIt depends on the angle.\r\nSo to calculate how much left, we use `|a| × cos(θ)`, \r\nand we got a **PROJECTION** or a reflection or a **shadow** of `a` on `b`! \r\nThen it become like this picture again:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38633159-62e797d2-3df1-11e8-8e6e-b7600a0b7d32.png)\r\nHow amazing it is!\r\nAnd now we could **Boost** the power on b: `|b| ×  |a|×cosθ`\r\n\r\n### `Ways of calculating dot product`\r\n\r\nThere're two ways to calculate the dot product (I made up the names):\r\n- Projection Boost: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38635179-24867f34-3df7-11e8-8571-ba6fa706aa3f.png)\r\n- Axes Boost: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38635195-2b519c04-3df7-11e8-8a73-34171669a673.png)\r\n\r\nResult of two ways are **SAME**.\r\n\r\n> Remember: Boosting is not working when two vectors are **Perpendicular**, which product is `0`.\r\n\r\n#### `Shadow Boost`\r\n> We reflect one vector on another one, then **Boost** the energy.\r\n\r\nIntuition:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38634997-a69cff08-3df6-11e8-98b4-a66c2e0c1156.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### `Axes Boost`\r\n> We break two vectors to `X-axis` and `Y-axis`, and BOOST on each axis.\r\n\r\nEasier to remember the formula is:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38634475-2a08a182-3df5-11e8-989e-11218ff847f8.png)\r\n\r\nIntuition:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38635041-bf54e088-3df6-11e8-9562-3f18002d288e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n###
