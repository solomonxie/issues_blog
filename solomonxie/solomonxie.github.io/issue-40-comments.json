`Matrices Elimination`\r\n> `Matrices elimination` (or `solving system of linear equations`) is the very first and fundamental skill throughout Linear Algebra. It's probably the first lesson of all sorts of courses.\r\n\r\n## Terminology\r\nBefore learning `solving systems of linear equations`, you really need to get familiar with all the core terminologies involved, otherwise it can be very hard to move on to next stage.\r\nAnd in this case, the best way to learn that is through Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nJFR, the core terms are: `Gaussian elimination`, `Gauss-Jordan elimination`, `Augmented Matrix`, `Elementary Row Operations`, `Elementary matrix`, `Row Echelon Form (REF)`, `Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)`, `Triangular Form`.\r\n\r\n### [`Gaussian elimination`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination)\r\n> It's a `Row reduction algorithm` to solve System of linear equations.\r\n\r\n[Refer to simple wiki: Gaussian elimination](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination)\r\n[Example: showme.com](http://www.showme.com/sh/?h=3fjkVEW)\r\n\r\nTo perform `Gaussian elimination`, the `coefficients of the terms in the system of linear equations` are used to create a type of matrix called an `augmented matrix`. \r\nThen, `elementary row operations` are used to **simplify** the matrix. \r\nThe **goal** of Gaussian elimination is to get the matrix in `row-echelon form`. \r\nIf a matrix is in `row-echelon form`, which is also called `Triangular Form`.\r\nSome definitions of Gaussian elimination say that the matrix result has to be in `reduced row-echelon form`. \r\n**Gaussian elimination that creates a reduced row-echelon matrix result is sometimes called `Gauss-Jordan elimination`.**\r\n\r\nTo be simpler, here is the structure:\r\n- Algorithm: `Gaussian Elimination`\r\n    - Step 1: Rewrite system to a `Augmented Matrix`.\r\n    - Step 2: Simplify matrix with `Elementary row operations`.\r\n    - Result:\r\n        - `Row Echelon Form` or\r\n        - `Reduced Echelon Form`\r\n\r\nAnd if we make the result only in `RREF`, so the name of the algorithm could also be called:\r\n- Algorithm: `Gauss-Jordan Elimination`\r\n    - Step 1: Rewrite system to a `Augmented Matrix`.\r\n    - Step 2: Simplify matrix with `Elementary row operations`.\r\n    - Result: Only in `Reduced Echelon Form`\r\n\r\n### `Elementary Row Operations`\r\nElementary row operations are used to **simplify the matrix**. \r\n\r\nThe three types of row operations used are:\r\n- Type 1: **Switching** one row with another **row**.\r\n- Type 2: **Multiplying** a row by a non-zero **number**.\r\n- Type 3: **Adding or subtracting** a row from another **row**.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nSuppose the goal is to find the solution for the linear system below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39080182-31be1c9a-455c-11e8-927e-773f3788b77a.png)\r\n\r\nFirst we need to turn it into `Augmented Matrix` form:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39080192-5804ace8-455c-11e8-96ec-57c0d884a69b.png)\r\n\r\nThen we apply `Elementary Row Operations`, and result in `Row Echelon Form`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39080203-a26b890a-455c-11e8-9f41-50c66079b22e.png)\r\n\r\nAt the end, if we'd like, we can further on apply some row operations to get the matrix in `Reduced Row Echelon Form`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39080275-2846e60a-455d-11e8-83c5-53b84fd5b45a.png)\r\nReading this matrix tells us that the solutions for this system of equations occur when x = 2, y = 3, and z = -1.\r\n\r\n### `Row Echelon Form vs. Reduced Row Echelon Form`\r\n[Refer to this lecture video: REF & RREF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W01H0LcVUdQ&index=10&list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxfUl0tcqPNTJsb7R6BqSLo6).\r\n\r\n## `Augmented Matrix`\r\n> Means we put another column into the matrix, which represents the **Right side** of the system of equations, numbers of right of the `=` sign.\r\n\r\nWhen we apply elimination to `Linear equations`, we operate both sides at the same time. But for computer programmes, it often apply to **Left side**, and remember the operations, a.g. multiply a number or add equations together, when the left side finished then apply the same operations to the right side.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39471215-829b2d90-4d74-11e8-97b1-7ce730e92e86.png)\r\n"}]
