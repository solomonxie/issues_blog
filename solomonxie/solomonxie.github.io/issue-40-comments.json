\r\nLiterally means how much distance to walk, how much walk horizontally and vertically. \r\nSince two vectors were added together means how much we move on the axis(on x and on y), instead of taking 4 steps we can just make it one step directly to the final point, the same final place. \r\nAnd draw an arrow from origin to it, then everything construct a beautiful triangle. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36588757-098a820a-18c4-11e8-9f32-62c4a66702a5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd two lists(vectors, coordinates)  much contain exact the same amount of distance indicator(number), otherwise it doesn’t make sense at all.\r\n2D, here it simply just means there’re two distance number in the list, like (2,-3). \r\nSo 3D means three distance number in the list, (2,-3, 5). \r\nNo matter how many dimensions are represented here, all we need to care about is how many pair of numbers we need to operate(add or multiply).\r\n\r\n\r\n## SCALING  (Multiplication of vector by a number)\r\n`SCALING` is what we say multiplication of a vector. \r\nLiterally just stretching, squishing or reversing direction of the vector(the position).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35763036-f0b92970-08dd-11e8-8686-2f7b3bfe2d87.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35763039-f918bd4c-08dd-11e8-9df0-69780a52b0ec.png)\r\n\r\nAnd the number(multiplier) besides the vector(position), we call it `SCALARS`, \r\nLiterally means how much we scale the vector(scale the movement from origin to the position, closer or further, forward or backward). \r\nThe scalar we also just call it `number` sometimes.\r\n\r\n## VECTOR ADDITION & SCALAR MULPIPLICATION.\r\nIt's the two Fundamental operation of vectors.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36589168-6302cfda-18c5-11e8-8381-79fe699dbf20.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAddition means moving the tip of an arrow to another position, multiplication means to scale the arrow line itself bigger or smaller.\r\n\r\n## BASIS OF VECTORS\r\n`i-hat` is a unit-vector (1 unit), only indicate x-distance. \r\nWhen it’s with a number(scalar), `i-hat` can be stretched or squished. \r\nSame with `j-hat`.  \r\n\r\nAnd i-hat and j-hat are called a pair of `BASIS VECTORS`.\r\nWhen adding two vectors(both with scalars) together, it becomes like this.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35763044-086c60a0-08de-11e8-9c3a-3942b8332a13.png)\r\n\r\n## LINEAR COMBINATION \r\nThe combination of two vectors(the result), is the 3rd line from the triangle. It’s a direct line from this tail to that tip, so it’s linear result(combination).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35763049-19499690-08de-11e8-8300-ec0762101da4.png)\r\n\r\n## SPAN\r\nwith two vectors, depends on situation(is one’s value already set up, or both aren’t set up and can be anywhere), and we scale them to all possible places, and what places it covers, is the SPAN of the two vectors.\r\nIf one is settled scaling rate, like -1.44, so no matter how much the other one move, all the movement will only draw a single line.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767628-fe157ee6-092a-11e8-9d3a-53c48284621a.png)\r\n\r\n## `LINEARLY DEPENDENT` and `LINEARLY INDEPENDENT`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767629-09e9c128-092b-11e8-9a80-d007b6a61849.png)\r\nIn the case two-dimension, if two vectors line up then it makes no space but a line, in three-dimension no sphere but a sheet. \r\nSo if any vector lines up with another, we call it `LINEARLY DEPENDENT`. Vice versa, if it makes space then we call it `LINEARLY INDEPENDENT`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767632-11aef59a-092b-11e8-9fd8-a5feda75ee80.png)\r\n## VECTOR SPACE\r\nOnly when vectors are linearly independent (not collapse with any other vector), its span can draw a space.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767635-171fca2c-092b-11e8-8834-39affa91e746.png)\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/comments/368837869","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40#issuecomment-368837869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40","id":368837869,"user":{"login":"solomonxie","id":14041622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14041622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-27T11:10:19Z","updated_at":"2018-03-02T18:53:02Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"#

How to calculate the ratio of an `direction angle`\r\n> `direction angle` is a term for vectors. It is the angle we care about for a vector, which is in between of the vector line and the positive side of axis-x.\r\n\r\n**The ratio of a `direction angle` is always drawn from the positive side of axis-x, so that you could know what direction is this vector going to.**\r\n\r\nFor a vector we only know its x-distance and y-distance, so in terms of trigonometry, or in `right triangle`, they're `Opposite` and `Adjacent`.  So that we could use `Tangent` to calculate the ratio, such as `tan⁻¹(y/x)`.\r\n\r\n**But the thing is**, `tan⁻¹(...)` always gives you a number less then 90. So we have to do some tricks for doing this when the direction angle's ratio of a vector is greater than 90, or lesser 0.\r\n\r\nTo classify those situations, we use the idea of `4 quadrant` of the axis system.\r\n\r\n> And once we see x and y, we could immediately identify which quadrant the vector will fall into, then use the different method to calculte as follow:\r\n\r\n### [1st Quadrant ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (+x, +y):\r\n```\r\nRatio = tan⁻¹(y/x)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![snip20180227_91](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36723018-1758cbf2-1bea-11e8-88dd-ae3753bbe2db.png)\r\n\r\n### [2nd Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (-x, +y):\r\n```\r\nRatio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 180\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36723008-12b4d618-1bea-11e8-988e-840d942b66a0.png)\r\n\r\n### [3rd Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/more-examples-finding-vector-angles) (-x, -y):\r\n```\r\nRatio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 180\r\n```\r\n\r\n![snip20180227_89](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36722966-f68032ee-1be9-11e8-808e-c623a3c248da.png)\r\n\r\n### [4th Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/more-examples-finding-vector-angles) (x, -y):\r\n```\r\nRatio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 360\r\n```\r\n\r\n![snip20180227_90](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36722956-eee1defc-1be9-11e8-9dcc-ab3c935afa48.png)\r\n\r\n"}]
