It's probably the first lesson of all sorts of courses.\r\n\r\n## Terminology\r\nBefore learning `solving systems of linear equations`, you really need to get familiar with all the core terminologies involved, otherwise it can be very hard to move on to next stage.\r\nAnd in this case, the best way to learn that is through Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nJFR, the core terms are: `Gaussian elimination`, `Gauss-Jordan elimination`, `Augmented Matrix`, `Elementary Row Operations`, `Elementary matrix`, `Row Echelon Form (REF)`, `Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)`, `Triangular Form`.\r\n\r\n### [`Gaussian elimination`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination)\r\n> It's a `Row reduction algorithm` to solve System of linear equations.\r\n\r\n[Refer to simple wiki: Gaussian elimination](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination)\r\n[Example: showme.com](http://www.showme.com/sh/?h=3fjkVEW)\r\n\r\nTo perform `Gaussian elimination`, the `coefficients of the terms in the system of linear equations` are used to create a type of matrix called an `augmented matrix`. \r\nThen, `elementary row operations` are used to **simplify** the matrix. \r\nThe **goal** of Gaussian elimination is to get the matrix in `row-echelon form`. \r\nIf a matrix is in `row-echelon form`, which is also called `Triangular Form`.\r\nSome definitions of Gaussian elimination say that the matrix result has to be in `reduced row-echelon form`. \r\n**Gaussian elimination that creates a reduced row-echelon matrix result is sometimes called `Gauss-Jordan elimination`.**\r\n\r\nTo be simpler, here is the structure:\r\n- Algorithm: `Gaussian Elimination`\r\n    - Step 1: Rewrite system to a `Augmented Matrix`.\r\n    - Step 2: Simplify matrix with `Elementary row operations`.\r\n    - Result:\r\n        - `Row Echelon Form` or\r\n        - `Reduced Echelon Form`\r\n\r\nAnd if we make the result only in `RREF`, so the name of the algorithm could also be called:\r\n- Algorithm: `Gauss-Jordan Elimination`\r\n    - Step 1: Rewrite system to a `Augmented Matrix`.\r\n    - Step 2: Simplify matrix with `Elementary row operations`.\r\n    - Result: Only in `Reduced Echelon Form`\r\n\r\n### `Elementary Row Operations`\r\nElementary row operations are used to **simplify the matrix**. \r\n\r\nThe three types of row operations used are:\r\n- Type 1: **Switching** one row with another **row**.\r\n- Type 2: **Multiplying** a row by a non-zero **number**.\r\n- Type 3: **Adding** a row from another **row**. (!Note: you can only **ADD** them but not **subtract**, but you can **ADD** a negative)\r\n\r\nConfusing operation: See where the `negative sign` was put:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39507688-b0f759aa-4e11-11e8-89b3-69846f64a53a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nSuppose the goal is to find the solution for the linear system below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39080182-31be1c9a-455c-11e8-927e-773f3788b77a.png)\r\n\r\nFirst we need to turn it into `Augmented Matrix` form:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39080192-5804ace8-455c-11e8-96ec-57c0d884a69b.png)\r\n\r\nThen we apply `Elementary Row Operations`, and result in `Row Echelon Form`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39080203-a26b890a-455c-11e8-9f41-50c66079b22e.png)\r\n\r\nAt the end, if we'd like, we can further on apply some row operations to get the matrix in `Reduced Row Echelon Form`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39080275-2846e60a-455d-11e8-83c5-53b84fd5b45a.png)\r\nReading this matrix tells us that the solutions for this system of equations occur when x = 2, y = 3, and z = -1.\r\n\r\n### `Row Echelon Form vs. Reduced Row Echelon Form`\r\n[Refer to this lecture video: REF & RREF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W01H0LcVUdQ&index=10&list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxfUl0tcqPNTJsb7R6BqSLo6).\r\n\r\nIt doesn't really matter it is a `Square Matrix` or not, there could be a `Diagonal` or `Main diagonal`, or you can't draw a diagonal at all. \r\nThe only thing matters is **WHAT ARE ABOVE 1 AND WHAT ARE BELOW 1.**\r\n\r\n- REF: For each column, all numbers **below** 1 MUST BE 0. Doesn't matter what numbers are above 1.\r\n- RREF: For each column, all numbers both **above & below** 1 MUST BE 0. We don't care about it if there's no 1 in the column.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39506655-9e283416-4e0c-11e8-9e58-1df4f85c25e6.png)\r\n\r\n## `Augmented Matrix`\r\n> Means we put another column into the matrix, which represents the **Right side** of the system of equations, numbers of right of the `=` sign.\r\n\r\nWhen we apply elimination to `Linear equations`, we operate both sides at the same time. But for computer programmes, it often apply to **Left side**, and remember the operations, a.g. multiply a number or add equations together, when the left side finished then apply the same operations to the right side.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39471215-829b2d90-4d74-11e8-97b1-7ce730e92e86.png)\r\n\r\nIf a given Matrix was told it's an `Augmented Matrix`, so we have to assume that the **Last Column** is **The Solution Column**.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39482311-20236e3e-4da1-11e8-859e-6954b2d33f4a.png)\r\n\r\n## `Equivalent systems & Equivalent Matrices`\r\n\r\n- Equivalent systems: Linear systems with the SAME SOLUTION SET.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39482863-30ad3ee0-4da3-11e8-9314-8e6c9010690e.png)\r\n- Equivalent matrices: Two matrices where One Matrix **can be turned** into the other matrix by some `elementary row operations`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39482947-735664c4-4da3-11e8-8d4b-fc1b233adc87.png)\r\n\r\n## `Pivot`\r\n> Or called the `Cursor`, or `Basic`, or `Basic variable`.\r\n\r\n[Refer to this video from mathispower4u.](http://youtu.be/HFbBclH99d0)\r\n\r\nIt means the value that represents the `unknown variable`  in each column. There's no `pivot` in a column if you can't get a 1 in that column.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39506959-5ef42898-4e0e-11e8-89e0-8002688d81fb.png)\r\n\r\n### `Free variables`\r\nIf there's no pivot in a column, that means this `unknown variable` of the column can be **any number**, so we call it a `free variable`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39507131-27751b7e-4e0f-11e8-9761-cef7ee48cd64.png)\r\n\r\n### `Pivot columns`\r\n\r\nThe `pivots` are found after `Row Reduction`, and then **go back** to the Original Matrix, the columns **WITH** pivots are called `pivot columns`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39507277-ce962f42-4e0f-11e8-8638-917697b3a341.png)\r\n\r\n### `Back Substitution`\r\nIt's simple: When you solve out one `unknown variable` in the Linear System, you put the value back to other equations. We call this process as `Back Substitution`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39522421-b93a512a-4e44-11e8-970c-b965fdee3808.png)\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/comments/385990238","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40#issuecomment-385990238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40","id":385990238,"user":{"login":"solomonxie","id":14041622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14041622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-02T14:08:29Z","updated_at":"2018-05-02T14:08:29Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39527938-55f55a72-4e55-11e8-9f4e-d5ca9a984596.png)\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/comments/386033645","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40#issuecomment-386033645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40","id":386033645,"user":{"login":"solomonxie","id":14041622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14041622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-02T16:13:17Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T09:06:58Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"#

Because:\r\n\r\n**THE RESULT OF THAT ROW OPERATION IS A COMBINATION OF THE ROWS.**\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Elementary Matrix`\r\n> It's also called `Elimination Matrix`.\r\n\r\n[Refer to this amazing good video by Mathispower4u: Elementary Matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H3JFH3IjB0&feature=youtu.be)\r\n[Refer to Mathispower4u: Write a Matrix as a Product of Elementary Matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMp8RfWtPwQ&feature=youtu.be)\r\n\r\nSimply saying, an `Elementary Matrix` is just an `Identity Matrix` with **ONLY ONE ELEMENT CHANGED**.\r\n\r\n`Elementary Matrix` must be **ONLY ONE ROW OPERATION** away from the `Identity Matrix`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39473567-0bc69f66-4d82-11e8-98d9-d7ff9f49760d.png)\r\n\r\nThe example above is an `elementary matrix` which only altered the `Row-2 Column-1 entry`, and we'd like to call it the `E₂₁ matrix`, which represents `the elementary matrix which fixed the 2-1 position`.\r\n\r\nThe reason we need an `elementary matrix` is to apply each one step of `Elimination of linear equations`.\r\nWhich means that, \r\n\r\n**FOR EVERY SINGLE STEP OF ELIMINATION, WE NEED AN ELEMENTARY MATRIX.**\r\n\r\nSo for **two steps of elimination**, we could represent it with `elementary matrices` as below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39473976-4b9e3534-4d84-11e8-90bf-4dc88a5ef825.png)\r\n\r\nCombining **all elimination steps** in ONE MATRIX:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39474381-4f43ebf0-4d86-11e8-8b0e-6d3788d67616.png)\r\n\r\n## `Permutation Matrix`\r\n> `Permutation Matrix` is **ANOTHER TYPE OF ELEMENTARY MATRIX**, and used only to **switch positions** of elements in the matrix, without changing any numbers.\r\n\r\nReview [Dr. Strang's lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVKj3LADCnA&feature=youtu.be&t=36m42s).\r\n\r\nExample: To **switch two ROWS of a matrix** by using a `permutation matrix`

exists, then we call this matrix `Invertible`, or `Non-singular`.\r\n\r\nAnd only with `square matrices`, the inverse can be both **right side** or **left side** with the original matrix to produce the `Identity Matrix`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39560342-d9d403f0-4ecf-11e8-8526-c704ad2d4811.png)\r\n\r\n### `Singular Matrix (No inverse)`\r\n\r\nSimplest way to tell if it's a `singular matrix` is to calculate its `Determinant` which we learnt in high school: It's a singular matrix if its determinant is ZERO.\r\nBut there's another way to tell:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39560934-b1d24c04-4ed4-11e8-9d8c-c0331fc8b2db.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Use Gauss-Jordan Elimination to get Inverse`\r\n\r\n**THIS

It's a great way to look at Gaussian Elimination.\"\r\n\r\n## `What's the Inverse of a product`\r\nAssume `A & B` are all invertible matrices, so what is `(AB)⁻¹`?\r\n\r\nYes, we multiply their inverses together `A⁻¹ & B⁻¹`, but in what order do we multiply these inverses?\r\n**IN REVERSE ORDER.**\r\nWhich makes:\r\n`(AB)(B⁻¹A⁻¹) = 𝐈` or `(B⁻¹A⁻¹)(AB) = 𝐈`. They perform in the same way get the same result.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39616176-bbd17dc8-4fac-11e8-99ca-ef76bd1bc55b.png)\r\nso:\r\n\r\n**`(AB)⁻¹ = (B⁻¹A⁻¹)`**\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Inverse of a Transposed Matrix`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39616136-80e71ede-4fac-11e8-87a6-e22360a42818.png)\r\n\r\nSo the Inverse of `(Aᵀ)⁻¹ = (A⁻¹)ᵀ`\r\n\r\n\r\n## `LU Decompose (without Row Exhcnage)`\r\n\r\n> \"L is the product of Inverses.\"\r\n\r\n**`L = E⁻¹`, which means L is the inverse of `elementary matrix`.**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39617446-580782dc-4fb2-11e8-8ed5-99b2e45cf696.png)\r\n\r\nAssume in the elimination process without row exchanges, we only apply `elementary matrices` to the matrix one by one.\r\nSo the `L` would be the **Inverse** of those elementary matrices, but in **Reverse order**.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39617696-45d219b4-4fb3-11e8-87e0-18d5dcec3dde.png)\r\n\r\n```py\r\nEA = U\r\nA =

picture of getting the L. \r\nBut actually what actually we get is really simple to observe:\r\n**If no row exchanges, multipliers go directly into L.**\r\n\r\nSo as we've understood the meaning behind it, we can forget it and just remember the **`multipliers`**.\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Row exchanges with Permutations`\r\n> For LU Decomposition, although we can't represent row exchanges with

so we change it to:\r\n```py\r\nPA = LU\r\n\r\n# P = Permutation Matrix = Identity Matrix with Reordered rows\r\n```\r\n**Which apply row exchanges to matrix A into the right order (for pivots), then decompose it.**\r\n\r\n### Permutation properties\r\n```py\r\nPossibilities of Permutations of nxn matrix = n!\r\n\r\nP⁻¹ = Pᵀ\r\nPᵀP = 𝐈\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `Transposes`\r\n\r\nThe way to do a transpose is just **SWITCH ENTRIES**.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39621993-394e1278-4fc3-11e8-827a-776bceb20e4f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Symmetric matrices`\r\n> It means the transpose of the matrix doesn't change it.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n#symmetric matrix\r\nAᵀ = A\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven any matrix R (not necessarily square) the product RᵀR is always symmetric, because after transposing it's still the same: \r\n```py\r\n(RᵀR)ᵀ = Rᵀ(Rᵀ)ᵀ = RᵀR`\r\n\r\n# Note: (Rᵀ)ᵀ = R, and matrix multiplications is from right to left.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Vector spaces`\r\n\r\n### Most important thing about vector spaces\r\n**We can do operations to any vector and still in the same space.**\r\nWe can add or scale or combine any R² vectors and we're still in R² space. \r\n\r\nIn another word, if you do some additions or scalings to a vector but turns out it jump out of the space, then **It can't be a vector space.**\r\ne.g., take the **positive part of R²** as a space, if we do additions to the vectors in it they will still be positive. BUT, if we apply a **negative scalars** to vectors, they will come out of the **positive space**. So it's not a Vector space.\r\n\r\n**EVERY VECTOR SPACE GOT TO HAVE THE ZERO VECTOR IN IT.**\r\n\r\n### Rules of Vector spaces\r\n\r\n[Refer to video by TheTrevTutor: Vector Spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvSsDsLVLs&list=PLDDGPdw7e6AjJacaEe9awozSaOou-NIx_&index=27&t=0s)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39636060-b0124ef0-4ff1-11e8-9a0f-dbf82d5f8875.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Subspaces`\r\nIf a Vector space is **INSIDE** of a Vector space e.g. R², we call it `The Subspace of R²`.\r\n\r\nAll Subspaces of R² | All Subspaces of R³\r\n-- | --\r\nThe whole R² space | The whole R³ space\r\n_-_ | Any plane goes through the Origin `(0,0)`\r\nAny line goes through Origin `(0,0)` | Any line goes through Origin `(0,0,0)`\r\nThe Zero vector itself (𝐙) | The Zero vector itself (𝐙)\r\n\r\nRemember the NO.1 rule of a Subspace:\r\n**ALL VECTOR COMBINATIONS FORM A SUBSPACE.**\r\n\r\n### Three rules of Subspace:\r\n- [ ] Contains Zero vector\r\n- [ ] Closed under addition\r\n- [ ] Closed under scalar multiplication\r\n\r\n## `Column Space`\r\n> Column space is a special kind of subspace, which comes out of **matrix**.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39627729-69449f72-4fd9-11e8-9359-eb3f76c275d5.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39627899-e3184ba0-4fd9-11e8-9a19-f6720bdee709.png)\r\n\r\n**Which means the column space of a matrix only have 3 vectors: 2 column vectors and a Zero vector, and the Column space(their linear combinations) forms a 2D plane.**"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/comments/386639070","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40#issuecomment-386639070","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40","id":386639070,"user":{"login":"solomonxie","id":14041622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14041622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-04T15:34:23Z","updated_at":"2018-05-05T08:59:05Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"# MIT OCW 18.06 SC  Unit 1.6Column Space and Nullspace\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39637014-6d9e29b0-4ff4-11e8-975f-00aa020aedc9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nLecture timeline | Links\r\n-- | --\r\nLecture | [0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o5Cmfpeo6g&index=6&list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8&t=161s)\r\nWhat are Vector spaces | [1:05](https://youtu.be/8o5Cmfpeo6g?t=1m5s)\r\nSubspaces of R³ | [2:33](https://youtu.be/8o5Cmfpeo6g?t=2m31s)\r\nIs the union of two subspaces a Subspace? | [4:23](https://youtu.be/8o5Cmfpeo6g?t=4m23s)\r\nColumn space | [11:36](https://youtu.be/8o5Cmfpeo6g?t=11m36s)\r\nFeatures a Column space | [14:46](https://youtu.be/8o5Cmfpeo6g?t=14m46s)\r\nHow much smaller is the Column space? | [15:48](https://youtu.be/8o5Cmfpeo6g?t=15m48s)\r\nDoes every `Ax=B` have a solution for every `B`? | [16:17](https://youtu.be/8o5Cmfpeo6g?t=16m17s)\r\nWhich `B`s allow the system of equations solved | [19:39](https://youtu.be/8o5Cmfpeo6g?t=19m39s)\r\nNull space | [28:12](https://youtu.be/8o5Cmfpeo6g?t=28m12s)\r\nUnderstand what's the point of a Vector space | [40:24](https://youtu.be/8o5Cmfpeo6g?t=40m24s)\r\n\r\n### Is the union of two subspaces a subspace?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39638399-aab7386a-4ff8-11e8-8a0d-c5e2ce2c5654.png)\r\n\r\n### How to form a Column space\r\nFor a 3x3 matrix,\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39639138-feef6450-4ffa-11e8-9b2b-105178c3026e.png)\r\nWe pick out three Column Vectors, and take all their **`Linear combinations`**, then we formed a **`Column space`**.\r\n\r\n> Definition: Column Space of A is all Linear combinations of A's columns.\r\n\r\n### Does every `Ax=B` have a solution for every `B`?\r\nNO!\r\nNot always, but sometimes.\r\n\r\n> \"The system of linear equations Ax = b is solvable exactly when b is a vector in the column space of A\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Null space Ax=0`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/39661357-d072ebe6-5082-11e8-9f3e-f3c952c1df91.png)\r\n\r\n> \"If you give me a Matrix A, and let me to find N(A).
