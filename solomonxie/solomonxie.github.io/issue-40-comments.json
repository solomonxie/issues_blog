How to calculate the ratio of an `direction angle`\r\n> `direction angle` is a term for vectors. It is the angle we care about for a vector, which is in between of the vector line and the positive side of axis-x.\r\n\r\n**The ratio of a `direction angle` is always drawn from the positive side of axis-x, so that you could know what direction is this vector going to.**\r\n\r\nFor a vector we only know its x-distance and y-distance, so in terms of trigonometry, or in `right triangle`, they're `Opposite` and `Adjacent`.  So that we could use `Tangent` to calculate the ratio, such as `tan⁻¹(y/x)`.\r\n\r\n**But the thing is**, `tan⁻¹(...)` always gives you a number less then 90. So we have to do some tricks for doing this when the direction angle's ratio of a vector is greater than 90, or lesser 0.\r\n\r\nTo classify those situations, we use the idea of `4 quadrant` of the axis system.\r\n\r\n> And once we see x and y, we could immediately identify which quadrant the vector will fall into, then use the different method to calculte as follow:\r\n\r\n### [1st Quadrant ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (+x, +y):\r\n```\r\nRatio = tan⁻¹(y/x)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![snip20180227_91](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36723018-1758cbf2-1bea-11e8-88dd-ae3753bbe2db.png)\r\n\r\n### [2nd Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/angles-of-vectors-from-components) (-x, +y):\r\n```\r\nRatio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 180\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36723008-12b4d618-1bea-11e8-988e-840d942b66a0.png)\r\n\r\n### [3rd Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/more-examples-finding-vector-angles) (-x, -y):\r\n```\r\nRatio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 180\r\n```\r\n\r\n![snip20180227_89](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36722966-f68032ee-1be9-11e8-808e-c623a3c248da.png)\r\n\r\n### [4th Quadrant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/v/more-examples-finding-vector-angles) (x, -y):\r\n```\r\nRatio = tan⁻¹(y/x) + 360\r\n```\r\n\r\n![snip20180227_90](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36722956-eee1defc-1be9-11e8-9dcc-ab3c935afa48.png)\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/comments/379998590","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40#issuecomment-379998590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40","id":379998590,"user":{"login":"solomonxie","id":14041622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14041622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T07:14:31Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T07:14:31Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"# Vector's magnitude & direction\r\n\r\nNow we got a vector start from `(-3,8)` to the point `(4, 5)`.  \r\nWe say this vector has a magnitude `||v|| = √40` and has a direction to the bottom right.\r\n\r\nBut we could also represent the vector as only `one point with two components`: `(7, -3)`.\r\nWhich has a **HIDDEN INFORMATION** that it start from the **origin** and direction is to the point `(7, -3)`.\r\n\r\nAre they different vectors?
