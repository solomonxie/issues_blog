So that we could get to any position that we want in the 2D plane, i.e., R².\r\n\r\nExceptions:\r\n- `span(0) = 0`, it only stay at origin.\r\n- `v = w`, if two vectors are the same, or `collinear`, then it's still ONE vector.\r\n\r\n## `Linearly dependent & independent`\r\n\r\n- `Linear dependence`: two vectors are **`COLLINEAR`**, means on the same line.\r\n- `Linear independence`: two vectors are **`NOT COLLINEAR`**, means they're not on the same line.\r\n\r\nVectors `(2, 3)` and `(4, 6)` are the **SAME VECTOR**! \r\nBecause `(4,6) = 2*(2,3)`, so it's just a scaled version of the first vector.\r\n\r\nSo we say the vectors `(2, 3)` and `(4, 6)` are **`DEPENDENT`**, because they're **`COLLINEAR`**.\r\n\r\nOther than that, any two vectors are **`INDEPENDENT`**, if they're not **NOT COLLINEAR**.\r\n\r\n### Linear combinations\r\n> `Linear combinations` means to add vectors together: `v₁ + v₂ + v₃.....`. Simple like that.\r\nI can say `some vectors`, or just to say `a linear combination`.\r\n\r\nLet's list some `vector combinations`:\r\n- Zero Vector: `span(0) = 0`.\r\n- One vector: `span(v) = a line`.\r\n- Two vector: `span(v₁, v₂) = R²`, if they're not collinear.\r\n- Three vector or more: `span(v₁, v₂, v₃...) = R²`. Other than two vectors, are all **`REDUNDANT`**. \r\nIn another word:\r\n**IF ANY TWO VECTORS ARE INDEPENDENT, THEN OTHERS ARE ALL DEPENDENT.**\r\n\r\n### How to know whether a linear combination is dependent\r\n\r\n[Refer to Khan lecture: Span and linear independence example](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/linear-independence/v/span-and-linear-independence-example)\r\n\r\nA `linear combination` is **dependent**, **iff** it could satisfy this equation:\r\n```py\r\nc₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + c₃v₃ .... = 0\r\n```\r\n`c..` means the scalar for each vector, and you could change the scalar to any number, positive or negative.\r\nNote that: `c ≠ 0`, and vectors are not all zeros.\r\n\r\nAssume that there's a linear combination of two vectors `v₁ + v₂`, \r\nwith scalars it could be `c₁v₁ + c₂v₂`.\r\nTo verify whether it's dependent or independent, \r\nwe assume `c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ = 0` and solve for `c₁ and c₂`:\r\n- If `c₁ or c₂` ARE NOT zero => it's **dependent**\r\n- if `c₁ = c₂ = 0` => it's **independent**.\r\n\r\nExample: `Is vectors (2,1) and (3,2) dependent or independent?`\r\nSolve:\r\n- Assume `c₁(2,1) + c₂(3,2) = 0`\r\n- Get system of equations:\r\n    - `2c₁ + 3c₂ = 0`\r\n    - `1c₁ + 2c₂ = 0`\r\n- Solve system of equations get: `c₁=c₂=0`\r\n- So it's a **independent linear combination**."}]
