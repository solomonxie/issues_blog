It becomes a VECTOR.\r\nSo a vector contains a meaning of movement, from origin to the position, rather than just a position itself.\r\n(But what’s the meaning of putting a origin and a movement from it?)\r\n\r\n## FOUR-STEP PATH\r\nPerfectly explains why two coordination(list, or say, vector) can be added! Literally means how much distance to walk, how much walk horizontally and vertically. \r\nSince two vectors were added together means how much we move on the axis(on x and on y), instead of taking 4 steps we can just make it one step directly to the final point, the same final place. And draw an arrow from origin to it, then everything construct a beautiful triangle. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35763033-e7a74a06-08dd-11e8-9cdf-3126d1755d55.png)\r\n\r\nAnd two lists(vectors, coordinates)  much contain exact the same amount of distance indicator(number), otherwise it doesn’t make sense at all.\r\nTwo-dimension, here it simply just means there’re two distance number in the list, like (2,-3). So three-dimension means three distance number in the list, (2,-3, 5). No matter how many dimensions are represented here, all we need to care about is how many pair of numbers we need to operate(add or multiply).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Multiplication of vector by a number\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35763036-f0b92970-08dd-11e8-8686-2f7b3bfe2d87.png)\r\n\r\n## SCALING\r\n`SCALING` is what we say multiplication of a vector. Literally just stretching, squishing or reversing direction of the vector(the position).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35763039-f918bd4c-08dd-11e8-9df0-69780a52b0ec.png)\r\n\r\nAnd the number(multiplier) put in front of the vector(position), we call it SCALARS. Literally means how much we scale the vector(scale the movement from origin to the position, closer or further, forward or backward). The scalar we also just call it number sometimes.\r\n\r\n## VECTOR ADDITION & SCALAR MULPIPLICATION.\r\nIt's the two Fundamental operation of vectors.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35763040-024337a8-08de-11e8-8b24-d5f33a7e49d0.png)\r\n\r\n## BASIS OF VECTORS\r\n`i-hat` is a unit-vector (1 unit), only indicate x-distance. When it’s with a number(scalar), `i-hat` stretch or squish. Same with `j-hat`.  And i-hat and j-hat are called a pair of `BASIS VECTORS`.\r\nWhen adding two vectors(both with scalars) together, it becomes like this.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35763044-086c60a0-08de-11e8-9c3a-3942b8332a13.png)\r\n\r\n### LINEAR COMBINATION \r\nThe combination of two vectors(the result), is the 3rd line from the triangle. It’s a direct line from this tail to that tip, so it’s linear result(combination).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35763049-19499690-08de-11e8-8300-ec0762101da4.png)\r\n\r\n## SPAN\r\nwith two vectors, depends on situation(is one’s value already set up, or both aren’t set up and can be anywhere), and we scale them to all possible places, and what places it covers, is the SPAN of the two vectors.\r\nIf one is settled scaling rate, like -1.44, so no matter how much the other one move, all the movement will only draw a single line.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767628-fe157ee6-092a-11e8-9d3a-53c48284621a.png)\r\n\r\n## `LINEARLY DEPENDENT` and `LINEARLY INDEPENDENT`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767629-09e9c128-092b-11e8-9a80-d007b6a61849.png)\r\nIn the case two-dimension, if two vectors line up then it makes no space but a line, in three-dimension no sphere but a sheet. \r\nSo if any vector lines up with another, we call it `LINEARLY DEPENDENT`. Vice versa, if it makes space then we call it `LINEARLY INDEPENDENT`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767632-11aef59a-092b-11e8-9fd8-a5feda75ee80.png)\r\n## VECTOR SPACE\r\nOnly when vectors are linearly independent (not collapse with any other vector), its span can draw a space.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767635-171fca2c-092b-11e8-8834-39affa91e746.png)\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/comments/362804021","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40#issuecomment-362804021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/40","id":362804021,"user":{"login":"solomonxie","id":14041622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14041622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie","html_url":"https://github.com/solomonxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomonxie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-03T12:52:48Z","updated_at":"2018-02-03T13:19:23Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"# why do I need to learn Linear Algebra?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35739336-3c34b4fe-086c-11e8-9d2b-4977444a9381.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35739713-77c687bc-086d-11e8-9846-dff7c996257c.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35740953-614256de-0871-11e8-92b6-17a21e355b93.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35745443-4524bc8c-087e-11e8-8919-d9011106320e.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35745578-b1c34a52-087e-11e8-80f5-adab00e699c7.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35745712-3d76e0b8-087f-11e8-8713-31faf23686f3.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35745729-4963b036-087f-11e8-8287-de6e091c1317.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35746374-881fa68e-0881-11e8-8140-3f4de885a47e.png)\r\n\r\n# To know what is a Linear Algebra, have to know what is the opposite \"Non-Linear Algebra\"\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35747277-a3586528-0884-11e8-9318-c17b8d9b7bb2.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767257-05f9b1ec-0924-11e8-8fcd-26d64fbb7af1.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767258-0d63d91c-0924-11e8-90dc-003a1f5e66c5.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767261-15955f20-0924-11e8-8051-973dcedbc501.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767264-22b33b28-0924-11e8-94ec-c767113c880f.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767288-8cb6bd38-0924-11e8-9a09-bcebcfda191c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35767305-f2e5bf00-0924-11e8-8da7-2762e0f5c657.png)\r\n\r\n"}]
