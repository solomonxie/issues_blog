the energy! \r\n**It's not ADDING together anymore**, it's `BOOSTING`!\r\nLet's say the force `a` has `3 units` power, `b` has `6 units` power. \r\nSo every `1 unit` power `a` pulls, `b` will pull `2 units` power.\r\nThen it make sense:\r\nThe total power pulling the thing would be `3 · 6 = 18 units`\r\n\r\n### `Vectors on different direction`\r\nSo the `Two forces` AREN'T pulling the box at the same direction anymore, how much power did it pulled on the `direction of a`, or how much on the `direction of b`?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38632862-91a762ce-3df0-11e8-9545-1e19ed677936.png)\r\n![screencast 2018-04-12

`a` is pulling on a bit **wrong way**, so **`a`'s power ISN'T 100% working on `b`'s way**.\r\nHow much power left there?\r\nIt depends on the angle.\r\nSo to calculate how much left, we use `|a| × cos(θ)`, \r\nand we got a **PROJECTION** or a reflection or a **shadow** of `a` on `b`! \r\nThen it become like this picture again:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38633159-62e797d2-3df1-11e8-8e6e-b7600a0b7d32.png)\r\nHow amazing it is!\r\nAnd now we could **Boost** the power on b: `|b| ×  |a|×cosθ`\r\n\r\n## `Ways of calculating dot product`\r\n\r\nThere're two ways to calculate the dot product (I made up the names):\r\n- Shadow Boost: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38635179-24867f34-3df7-11e8-8571-ba6fa706aa3f.png)\r\n- Axes Boost: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38635195-2b519c04-3df7-11e8-8a73-34171669a673.png)\r\n\r\nResult of two ways are **SAME**.\r\n\r\n> Remember: Boosting is not working when two vectors are **Perpendicular**, which product is `0`.\r\n\r\n### `Shadow Boost`\r\n> We reflect one vector on another one, then **Boost** the energy.\r\n\r\nIntuition:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38634997-a69cff08-3df6-11e8-98b4-a66c2e0c1156.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### `Axes Boost`\r\n> We break two vectors to `X-axis` and `Y-axis`, and BOOST on each axis.\r\n\r\nEasier to remember the formula is:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38634475-2a08a182-3df5-11e8-989e-11218ff847f8.png)\r\n\r\nIntuition:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38635041-bf54e088-3df6-11e8-9562-3f18002d288e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n###

It's fairly important and can't get away with.\r\n\r\n> `Linear transformation` is a special kind of Transformation, which deals with `vectors`.\r\n\r\nNeed to mention that, 3Blue1Brown has done well on build intuition on this topic:\r\nRefer to 3Blue1Brown's video: [Linear transformations and matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=4)\r\nRefer to the same video: [How does linear transformation work on unit vectors](https://youtu.be/kYB8IZa5AuE?t=3m47s)\r\nRefer to 3Blue1Brown's video: [Three-dimensional linear transformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHLEWRxRGiM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=6)\r\nRefer to 3Blue1Brown's video: [Matrix multiplication as composition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkY2DOUCWMU&index=5&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)\r\n\r\n\r\n> \"Matrices give us  **a language** to describe these transformations, where the columns represent those coordinates. \r\nAnd matrix-vector multiplication is just a way to compute what that transformation does to a given vector. \r\nEvery time you see a matrix, you can interpret it as a certain transformation of space. \r\nOnce you digest the idea, you’re in a great position to understand the linear algebra deeply. \r\n**Almost all of the topics in linear algebra will become easy to understand once you start thinking about matrices as transformations of space.**\" - 3Blue1Brown\r\n\r\n\r\n**YOU JUST HAVE TO MEMORISE THIS EQUATION AND GET THE IDEA. THAT IS GONNA HELP YOU OUT FROM ALL THE IDEAS AND PROBLEMS IN LINEAR ALGEBRA.**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38699787-a0232910-3ecb-11e8-844e-30ccf58a5500.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Change the basis`\r\n> `Changing basis` is the very core of Linear Transformation. Every single move is based on this.\r\n\r\nRemember a vector `(a, b)` could also present in `unit vector` form as `v = ai + bj`,\r\nand unit vectors are `i = (1, 0) & j = (0, 1)`.\r\n\r\nIf we want to transform a vector, like `move, flip, rotate, scale`, the thing we'll do is:\r\n**TO CHANGE THE UNIT VECTOR `i` AND `j`**.\r\n\r\nFor example, there's a vector `v = (-1, 2)`, and it can present as `v = -1i + 2j`, then we're to do some movement to it:\r\n- Move: We let unit vector `i = (100, 0)`, then the vector moves to the right becomes `(-100, 2)`.\r\n- Rotate: we let unit vector `i = (0, 1)` and `j = (-1, 0)`, then the vector rotates 90° becomes `(-2, -1)`.\r\n**THAT'S THE MAGIC!!**\r\n\r\nBy telling where the `unit vectors` are to go, we can create a pattern, a mapping rule, so that every vector uses this map, this rule, this pattern will have the same transformation!\r\n\r\nAnother example: \r\nAssume there's a vector `v=(5,7)`, and let the unit vector `i=(3,-2)` and `j=(2,1)`, and present this **`TRANSFORM PATTERN`** as below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38697466-ae386936-3ec4-11e8-82b8-b88130a4906b.png)\r\n\r\nAnd we present this `Applying a transformation to a vector` in the form below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38697449-9b20935a-3ec4-11e8-917a-342a23259eec.png)\r\n\r\n**SO WHENEVER YOU ENCOUNTER MATRIX MULTIPLICATION AGAIN, NEVER READ IT AS TWO VECTORS OR TWO MATRICES MULTIPLYING TOGETHER!**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## `How to interpret a Matrix Multiplication`\r\n\r\nThere're only TWO part of this matrix multiplication:\r\n- `The Graph`: the 1st on right item.\r\n- `The Rules`: All the rest Matrices on the left of `The Graph`.\r\n\r\n`The Graph` could be one point (vector) or many points (vectors), e.g.:\r\n- A point: `(2,3)`\r\n- A triangle: `[ (3,0)   (0,4)   (3,4) ]`\r\n- A rectangle: `[ (3,0)   (3,4)    (0,4)  (0,0)]`\r\n- Any shape in any dimension.....\r\n\r\nSO ALL YOU NEED TO DO, IS JUST TO APPLY THOSE RULES ONE BY ONE, `LEFT BY RIGHT`, AND GET A NEW GRAPH!!!\r\n\r\nFor example, we apply two transform rules to a vector `(x, y)`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38699596-0936739a-3ecb-11e8-93ea-8fdd79af23e4.png)\r\n\r\nIt's exactly same with the function principles: `Shear( Rotate(x, y) )`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38699833-cb3ac450-3ecb-11e8-8364-bb1540ab33ae.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## `Break up the Matrices with its Geometric meaning`\r\n\r\nIn the `transform rule` as below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38698610-39ec988c-3ec8-11e8-9fac-759fe64ff376.png)\r\n\r\n**WE HAVE TO BREAK THE MATRICES INTO SINGLE PARTS BEFORE WE DO THE CALCULATION.** \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38698753-b2b7801a-3ec8-11e8-843b-3431c4955d46.png)\r\n\r\nAnd since we made the rule for `i & j`, so let's apply the `unit vector` to `the Graph`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38698988-632deb46-3ec9-11e8-9fd1-5edfef552f0f.png)\r\n\r\nNote that: \r\n- The original graph is `v = 5i + 7j`, so after applying the new rule of `i & j`, we get: \r\n`v = 5(3,-2) + 7(2,1)`\r\n- And now we could do the `Vector multiply a scalar` method, to get this:\r\n`v = (15,-10) + (14,7)`\r\n- Then we could do `Add two vectors`:\r\n`v = (19, -3)`\r\n- So after applying the transformation rule, we successfully transformed the vector to a new position:\r\n `(19,
