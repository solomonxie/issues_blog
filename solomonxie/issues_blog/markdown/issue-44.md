# What are sine, cosine, tangent?  (TRIGONOMETRY)

- [Khan short video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-trig/hs-geo-trig-ratios-intro/v/basic-trigonometry)
- [Maths is Fun](http://www.mathsisfun.com/sine-cosine-tangent.html)

## First to know the terms
It's only applicable to an `Right triangle`.  A right triangle is a triangle with a 90-degree angle.
The angle we pick out, is called `Θ`, theta. In `vector` related problems, it's also called the `direction angle`, see [this Khan practice](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/e/direction-angles).

The side opposite to that angle is called `Opposite`.
The side next to the angle is called `Adjacent`, "A-Jason-t".
The side is long is called `Hypotenuse`, "High-po-ten-news`.

## How to calculate sine, cosine and tangent of an angle 
REMEMBER SHORTCUT: `SOH-CAH-TOA`, pronounced "so-kah-tow-ah".
- `S`in = `O`pposite / `H`ypotenuse 
- `C`on = `A`djacent / `H`ypotenuse
- `T`an = `O`pposite / `A`djacent

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/36720552-5e5182ee-1be3-11e8-92d1-33e1f0218ee8.png)


## How to calculate the ratio of an angle?
We want to know what the ratio of an angle is, 60° or 59°?
If we know `tan(x) = 123`, whatever, then we can get it by `x = tan_inverse(123)`.
`tan_inverse(...)` or `tan⁻¹(...)` are the same.


## Reciprocal trig ratios: `Cosecant`, `Secant`, `Cotangent`

[Khan notes.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry-home/right-triangles-topic/reciprocal-trig-ratios-geo/a/reciprocal-trig-ratios)

- Cosecant: `csc(θ) = 1 / sin(θ)`
- Secant: `sec(θ) = 1 / cos(θ)`
- Cotangent: `cot(θ) = 1 / tan(θ)`

# Mean absolute deviation (MAD) - STATS
`The deviation` is the distance from the value to the `mean` value. 
It's used to describe how the values looks like or how they're laid on the axis, are they close to each other or far away.

The `Mean absolute deviation` is the absolute average of all deviations.

[Khan lecture.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geometry-pythagorean-theorem/pythagorean-theorem-distance/v/example-finding-distance-with-pythagorean-theorem)

Easy way to do this:
Make a triangle with two points same with the given points, and solve the length of the triangle.

# [`Pythagorean theorem`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/pythagoras.html) (TRIANGLE)
勾股定理。
Pronounced: `Pe~'tha-gor-rean 'Theor-rem`
In a right angled triangle:
the square of the hypotenuse is equal to
the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37077006-f34959c2-2213-11e8-8ecf-70ae86c4b6b6.png)

# [`Triangle inequality theorem`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/triangle-inequality-theorem.html)
In a triangle, the sides always follow these two rules:
- Any side of a triangle is always **shorter** than the sum of the other two sides
- The third side must be also **larger** than the difference between the other two sides

Example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37251267-c494ccc4-2547-11e8-9615-eff353c66ac3.png)



# [Complementary, supplementary, vertical angles](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-angle/vert-comp-supp-angles/a/complementary-and-supplementary-angles-review)

- `Complementary angles` are two angles with a **sum of 90°**. A common case is when they form a right angle.

# [`Transformations`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence) (GEOMETRY)

> Transformation means something's changing, transforming. 

Types of transformations:
- [`Translations`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-transformations-intro/a/intro-to-translations): Slide or move the shape. In geometry, a translation moves a thing up and down or left and right.
- [`Rotation`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-transformations-intro/a/intro-to-rotations): Turn or rotate the shape. In geometry, rotations make things turn in a cycle around a definite center point. 
- [`Reflection`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence/basic-geo-reflections/a/reflecting-shapes): Flip or mirror the shape. A reflection is a transformation that acts like a mirror: It swaps all pairs of points that are on exactly opposite sides of the line of reflection.
- [`Dilation`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence/basic-geo-dilations/v/dilating-from-an-arbitrary-point-example): Expand or shrink the shape.

And,
you can group above types of transformations into two groups: `Rigid transformations` and `Dilations`

## [`Rigid transformations`](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Geometry/Transformations/TRRigidTransformations.html) and [`Congruent`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/congruent.html)

> `Rigitd transformations` means you play around the shape without expanding or shrinking it.
Or say, without dilation, all translation/rotation/reflection would be `rigid transformation`.

`Congruent` is the shape after you "rigid transformed`.
Or say, without dilation, after all translation/rotation/reflection, the shape is called "congruent" to the original shape.

## [`Dilations`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-dilations/v/example-identifying-the-center-of-dilation)

> `Dilation`, just a fancy word for "resizing", or "scaling".

Notice that: Dilation **DOES NOT** change any angle within the shape.
Don't get confused with a `horizontal stretch`, which **does change** both sides and angles.

### [`Similarity`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/similar.html)

> When you resize, or say dilate a shape, you call the new shape **`similar`** to the original one.
If nothing changed with the shape, you call it **`congruent`** to the original one.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37207208-f233a2d0-23d6-11e8-8652-ee0e1a913b02.png)


### [`Scale factor`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-dilations/v/dilation-scale-factor)

> Means how much you scale the shape, like 2 times bigger, or 2/3 smaller.

Notice:
- The scale factor is of the length of the shape, NOT the area of it.

#### Scale factors and area
> When you scale the shape, the **area** of the new shape is **(scale facto)² times** to the original one. 

[Khan lecture: Scale factors and area](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-seventh-grade-math/cc-7th-geometry/cc-7th-scale-drawings/v/scale-factors-and-area)

For Shape A and scaled shape A', it leads to two practical conclusions:
- If we know the `scale factor` is x, then the area of A is x² times to the original one.
- If we know the ratio `(area of A')` ÷ `(area of A)` is x, then the `scale factor` is `√x`

### `Dilation Center`

>"Dilate the shape ABOUT a point P", means take the point as a center to dilate the shape.

How does it work? As the picture below, just simply **scale the distance** from each vertex(point) of the shape to the point.

#### How to find the dilation center?
> The point P and it's image and dilation center, should be IN ONE LINE !

## Surface Area
- Surface of cylinder: `2π · r · (r + h)`
- Surface of sphere: `4π · r²`

## Volume of Cuboids, Rectangular Prisms and Cubes
Volume = Length · Width ·  Height

## [Volume of Cone, sphere, Cylinder](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/cone-sphere-cylinder.html)

The volume of a cylinder is: `π · r² · h`
The volume of a cone is: `1/3 π · r² · h`
The volume of the sphere is:`4/3 π · r³`

## [Volume, surface area of Pyramid](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/pyramids.html)
- The **Volume** of a Pyramid: `1/3 · [Base Area] · Height`
- The **Surface Area** of a Pyramid: 
    - When all side faces are the same: `[Base Area] + 1/2 Perimeter · [Slant Length]`
    - When side faces are different: `[Base Area] + [Lateral Area]`


# [Rational & irrational numbers](http://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html)

> A rational number can always be expressed as a `fraction of two integers`.
vice versa, a irrational number cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers.

`A square root of a non-perfect square` is an irrational number, because it cannot be expressed as the fraction of two integers.

# [Stem and Leaf Plots](http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/stem-leaf-plots.html)

> A `Stem and Leaf Plot` is a special table where each data value is split into a "stem" (the first digit or digits) and a "leaf" (usually the last digit).

[Khan lecture.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-math-reasoning/pre-algebra-stem-leaf/v/reading-stem-and-leaf-plots)

In the above plot: 
- The `stem column` means the tens number of the whole number.
- The `row column` means the ones number of the whole number.
For example, the numbers of the second row represent: 12, 13, 15.

How the `Stem and Leaf Plot` represent numbers, it depends on the context. Stem can represents number of tens place, or ones place; Leaf can represents ones place or even decimal places.

# Proportional relationship
Linearly, if x and y has a relationship that one is another's proportion, then they have a `proportional relationship`. Expression as:
`y/x = k.`

Or it's a version of linear equation `y=mx +b`, only the b=0, then `y=mx`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37138548-7291bebe-22e5-11e8-8c4f-44599cd77d00.png)

At the showing image above, only first one shows a proportional relationship. The other two are not linear and going through origin.


## Directly Proportional & Inversely Proportional

[Refer to Maths is fun.](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/directly-inversely-proportional.html)

- `Directly proportional`: As one amount **increases**, another amount **increases** at the same rate.

# `Three Terms ratio problem`
```c
It takes 54 minutes for 4 people to paint 6 walls.
How many minutes does it take 6 people to paint 7 walls?
```
- 4 p 1 wall: 54 / 6 = 9 minutes, then:
- 1 p 1 wall: 9 * 4 = 36 minutes, then: 
- 1 p 7 wall: 36 * 7 = 252 minutes, then:
- 6 p 7 wall: 252 / 6 = 42 minutes.

Note that, it cannot be easily get out the result, but only to understand the context and make it out step by step.

# [`Polynomials`](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/polynomials.html)
Just an expression of some values, including variables, exponents, constants...

## `Degrees` of a polynomial
> Means the highest `exponent` of a variable in the polynomial.

For example, if it's a `quadratic`, then it's a `2nd degree polynomial`.

## Different forms a quadratic
> There're many tricks to convert one form to another, mainly depends on what information we have and what information we'd like to get.

Common forms for quadratic as below:
- `Standard form`: 
- `Two binomials form`: Could get two solutions without calculator.
- `Perfect square form`: Could get the positions of `vertex` by only eyeballing it. In another way, you could tell how much the graph was moved from the `origin point`.



## What is the `Solutions` to the quadratic
> The `solutions` to the Quadratic Equation are where it is equal to **ZERO.**

They are also called **`ROOTS`,** or sometimes **`ZEROS`**, or **`REAL ZEROS`**, OR **`REAL NUMBER ZEROS`**, or **`DISTINCT REAL NUMBER ZEROS`**.
Graphically, when the graph touches `x-axis`, the point is **`A SOLUTION`** to the quadratic equation.

There're different ways to get solutions for the quadratic:
- Factor the quadratic as a product of `two binomials`
- Re-group the quadratic, and then factor it
- Use `Quadratic Formula`.

## To factor a quadratic as the product of two binomials
> To find out the answer quickly and get intuition of it step by step, visit this cheat online solver: [Cymath](https://www.cymath.com/).

It's easy to expand product of two binomials to a quadratic, but tricky to factor them back.

What we should do is, in the standard quadratic form `ax² + bx +c = 0`, we are to:
- Find the two common factors of "c"
- Be sure the sum of two factors equals to "b"
As the example below, factors of "c" could be 4 and 6, and the sum of them is 10. So the answer is `(x+4)(x+6)`
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37166444-00c1c662-233a-11e8-9e14-3907f2f56bc8.png)

[Khan notes 2.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/polynomial-factorization/factoring-quadratics-2/a/factoring-quadratics-leading-coefficient-not-1)

The way to do it is, in the standard form of `Ax²+Bx+C`:
- Find two numbers add up equal `B`
- The product of the two numbers should equal to `A×C`
- Regrouping `Bx` to two terms of `x` with the two number.



## [Use `Quadratic formula` to solve equation](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/quadratic-equation-derivation.html)

The meaning of it, is to tell us about `the solution of a quadratic`:
- when `b2 − 4ac` is **POSITIVE**, we get **`TWO Real solutions`**. (It touches `x-axis` twice.)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37552160-6b266506-29ea-11e8-93d1-a28e80d6cca2.png)

- when it is **ZERO** we get just **`ONE Real solution`**. (Its `vertex` is on `x-axis`.)

- when it is **NEGETIVE** we get **`TWO Complex solutions`**. (It won't touch `x-axis` at all.)

A `parabola` always has a `vertex`, either its `top point` or `bottom point`.
If you draw a **vertical line** goes through the `vertex`, it can divided the graph into `two mirrored part`.

## The `Concavity` of parabola
- When it opens up, we also call it `Concave up`,
- When it opens down, we also call it `Concave down`.


## [`Equation forms` of a Parabola](http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/parabola/standard-and-vertex-form.php)

There're two common forms of equation to express the parabola:
`Standard form` and `Vertex form`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37553117-5e6d56fa-29fc-11e8-8bab-5a7be851e55b.png)

And there's another form for the parabola: 
the `Factor form`.

## [How to get the `Axis of symmetry`](http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/parabola/axis-of-symmetry.php)

> For a parabola, the `Axis of symmetry` goes through the `vertex`, which represent the `x position` of the `vertex`.

The `formula equation` of Axis of symmetry:
- In the `Vertex form` of quadratic `y = (x-h)² + k`, the symmetry line is: **`x = h`**. 
Mind that, to understand this form, refers to the `Absolute value graph` notion.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37553098-e2839248-29fb-11e8-8ef9-db91cbf1a328.png)

- In the `Standard form` of quadratic `y=ax²+bx+c`, the symmetry line is: **`x=−b/2a`**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37552727-94427d52-29f5-11e8-92d4-53e6650558ba.png)

- In the `Factor form` of quadratic `y=c(x-a)(x-b)`, the symmetry line is: **`x=(a+b)/2`**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37553110-31e45b1a-29fc-11e8-9fc6-093562f5d4ed.png)

## How to get the `Vertex`
Getting the `Axis of symmetry` is half way to get the `vertex`, since it can only represent the `x position` of vertex. 
For getting the `y position`, just input the `x value` into the equation, and get the `y value`.
Solved.

It's easier to get the vertex in the `factor form` of quadratic:

Then the `vertex` is `(h, k)`.

## How to graph the quadratic
To graph a quadratic, we have a few different ways, and each needs the information of a few points:
- A `vertex` point, two `root` points.
- A `vertex` point, a `y-intersect` point.
- A `vertex` point, any two points on the graph.

[Refer this page to review how to get a parabola's intersects.](http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/parabola/parabola-intercepts.php)

- To get two `roots`:
Just solve the equation and get two solutons (if there're two solutions).

- To get the `y-intersect` point:
Simply let the `x=0`, 
and solve the quadratic to get `y` position of the vertex.
And input the `y` value to the equation, to solve `x` position. Then we get the vertex:
`(x, y)`

- To get `any two points` of the graph:
Just ASSUME two `x positions`,
then input to the quadratic, to get `y positions`. Then we get:
`(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`

### Equation for the parabola

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37862802-13658492-2f8e-11e8-8c65-1f1cd9950c71.png)

In this graph above, we will get an equation by `Pythagorean Theorem`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37862810-2c106f8e-2f8e-11e8-98b5-fa078ec2cb4e.png)

And expand that equation, we got a parabola equation in `Vertex quadratic form`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37862814-52196fa0-2f8e-11e8-9b73-5d6d07569112.png)

```py
y = c (x - i)² + j
```
So we could spot out the `focus` and `directrix` information from a vertex quadratic equation.
In which, the `(i, j)` represent the `vertex`, `(h, k)` represents the `focus`, and the `y=k` represents the `directrix`.



# [`Bisect`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/bisect.html)
`Bisect` is a verb, means to divide into two equal parts.
You can bisect a line segment, an angle, a shape, etc.

Bisector is the point or line or anything you use to divide things.
An `angle bisector` is a line, or you could say you draw a line bisects the angle.

## [`Angle Bisector Theorem`](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Geometry/Similarity/SMAngle.html)
When we draw an `angle bisector` in a triangle, we get two equal ratio of related lines.

It could be also two ratios like this:

# [Cross Sections](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/cross-sections.html) (Geometry)
`Cross sections` is a interesting geometry problem, it let you thinks about how to slice a 3D solid shape into some 2D shapes, for instance:
- Slice a cube into:
    - `triangle` (3 sides)
    - `square` (4 sides)
    - `rectangle` (4 sides)
    - `pentagon` (5 sides)
    - `hexagon` (6 sides)
- Slice a pyramid into:
    - `triangle` (3 sides)
    - `square` (4 sides)
    - `rectangle` (4 sides)
    - `trapezoid`  (4 sides)
    - `pentagon` (5 sides)
- Slice a triangular prism into:
    - `triangle` (3 sides)
    - `square` (4 sides)
    - `rectangle` (4 sides)
    - `pentagon` (5 sides)
- Slice a cylinder into:
    - `circle` (no straight sides)
- Slice a cone into:
    - `triangle` (3 sides)
    - `circle` (no straight sides)

Note:
- To slice it must be using a plane to cut through.
- You can not only slice the 3D shape horizontally and vertically, but also any angle you like to get it.

# Intro to Probability
> It's easy but always confusing if you haven't yet totally understood it in the first place.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38343433-8df4d290-38b6-11e8-9412-2db6f33ba802.png)


The very first thing to do for solving a probability problem, is to CATEGORISE the problem and apply different formula.

- One event
- One event repeats
- Independent events in sequence

## `ONE event`
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37280286-518afa32-2628-11e8-87ad-b293b37741e1.png)

- The probability of an event can only be **0 to 1**  (or 0% to 100%).
- The probability of event **`A`** is often written as **`P(A)`**.
- The probability of an event with condition is often written as **`P(condition)`**.

Common cases:
- Flip a coin:  P(head) = 1/2.
- Roll a die: P(>3) = 3/6

#### `Theoretical & experimental probabilities`
The formula `Fav outcomes / Total outcomes` only gives you the `Theoretical probability`.
But when you do some experiments, like flip a coin 10,000 times, 
and you may find out the probability of the result of experiments is way so different than the theoretical one.

### `One event repeats`
> It's asking for 

Example: `Roll a die 100 times, how many times will you get a number greater than 3?`
Answer: P(>3) = 3/6 *100
The probability is 50 times.

## `Multiple events`

### `Independent events in sequence`
> `A & B` happening

### `Independency`
> To understand probability, we really need to differentiate `independent events` and `dependent events`.

[Khan lecture: `Compound probability of independent events`.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/prob-comb/compound-probability-of-ind-events-using-mult-rule/v/compound-probability-of-independent-events)

`Coin flips` are INDEPENDENT events: 
What happens in the first flip in no way affects what happens in the second flip.

And this is actually one thing that many people don't realise.

#### `Gambler's Fallacy`
> There's someone who thinks, if he got a bunch of heads in a row, then all of a sudden, it becomes more likely on the next flip to get a tails. 

**THAT IS NOT THE CASE.**

**Every flip is an independent event.** What happened in the past in these flips does not affect the probabilities going forward.


### `Sample space`
A dummy method,  just to draw a table or a tree shows every outcome it could be, and pick out all favourable results.

There're some [`repeating decimals`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal) or [`recurring decimals`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal), it's way more easier to write down with a fraction. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37325649-b7ae39d6-26c9-11e8-8aca-445080b7b6f6.png)

An online solver here:
[Calcul.com](http://www.calcul.com/show/calculator/recurring-decimal-to-fraction?i=0.[7])


#### The trick to do so is, to set up two numbers multiplied by 10 or 100 or 1000 or greater, letting their repeating part to fit to each decimal places. Like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37325848-866d8ea2-26ca-11e8-8915-d4b749824aa8.png)

Here're some examples to convert repeating decimals to fraction:
- For simple repeating: set the number as x, then for example:

## `Classification of numbers`

[Refer to Khan academy.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-eighth-grade-math/cc-8th-numbers-operations/cc-8th-irrational-numbers/a/classifying-numbers-review)

It's easy to classify most of the times, just to notice that:
- `Whole number` means `positive integers and zero`.
- `Rational number` must be able to represent as **a fraction of two numbers**.

# [`Equivalent` systems of equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/systems-of-linear-equations/equivalent-systems-of-equations/a/equivalent-systems-of-equations-review)

The word `equivalent` here for system of equation, means **both systems have the same solution**.
Equations in two systems, don't have to be the same thing at all. **If you draw a line for each equation, there could be very different lines for each one.**

Let's say it's in 2D, that term here literarily means two systems of 4 lines end up crossing at the same point (x,y), aka the solution.

## How to determine if two systems are equivalent
You could either solve the solution for each system then compare the solution, or just to compare each equation with the counterpart(only in a easy case).

### Solving method: `Elimination`
Ordinary way at middle school level: to eliminate variables and solve each variable one by one.

[Khan review.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/systems-of-linear-equations/equivalent-systems-of-equations/a/elimination-method-review)

### Solving method: Compare equations

# `Proportional relationships`
Refers to a function like `y = mx`.
y and x have a proportional relationship, means they must go through a point (0,0).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37390114-c0baa98c-27a1-11e8-9c9b-3b88eb517e5e.png)

## `Unit rate` of proportional relationship
> `The unit rate of change of y with respect to x` is the amount y changes for a change of one unit in x.


# [`Compound inequalities`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/one-variable-linear-inequalities/compound-inequalities/a/compound-inequalities-review)

Means an inequality that combines two simple inequalities, 
and our mission is to find out the solution of the compound inequality.

There are two kind of combination with relationship `AND` and `OR`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37443401-e2757cc8-2846-11e8-9d00-bf8ebf950c18.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37443376-c76a4a76-2846-11e8-9061-e95d85e38e04.png)


## Solve compound inequalities
> Just solve each simple inequality get the `range` of `x`, then compare two ranges in graph or in mind to get conclusion. 
Mind that, if it's in AND case, you need to take the **overlap of two ranges;** If it's in OR case, you have to take **both two ranges as solution**.

Example for `OR`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37443595-019a607c-2848-11e8-96d1-8a6facb3d540.png)
we get `x ≥ 2` and `x > 1`
Since it has overlap and it's in OR case, so we take all ranges, as `x > 1` can represent all.

Example for `no solution`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37443537-b38c12cc-2847-11e8-883d-958e7c159cf3.png)
To solve this and get:
`x > -1` and `x < -1`
You can't be greater and less than something at same time, so **no solution** for this case.


# [`Dimensional analysis`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis)

> Means `to convert a unit to another unit`.

For example, convert 60 km/h to 60000 m/h, or to 1 km/minute.
It works out many problem in physical science and engineering problems.

Another example, to convert 10 mile/hour to meter/second:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37445107-cdebe256-2850-11e8-8891-dd443f6ac976.png)


There're some tricks to convert units:
[Khan lecture: Intro to dimensional analysis](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/units-in-modeling/rate-conversion/v/dimensional-analysis-units-algebraically)
[Math is fun: How to Safely Convert From One Unit to Another
](https://www.mathsisfun.com/measure/unit-conversion-method.html)

Another example:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37445816-ff034150-2854-11e8-8734-b1dc8e70ab12.png)

We need to convert both `L` and `min`, 
so for `L` we can multiply it by `1000 mL/L` just to remove `L`. Because `1000 mL/L` equals to 1, it's safe to do so.
Similarly, for `1/min` we can multiply it by `min/60sec` to remove `min`.
To see below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37446145-85f0a8aa-2856-11e8-8171-c5c158c6b92b.png)

to simplify this equation we will get:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37446084-3c4afc5a-2856-11e8-9255-083d719983a2.png)



# [`Point-slope form of linear equation`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/two-var-linear-equations/point-slope/a/point-slope-form-review)

We all know the `slope-intersect form` of a linear equation is `y = mx + c`, which `m` is the `slope of line`, `c` is the constant represent the `y-intersect of the line`.
And we can convert it to another form: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37447392-e2ab704c-285c-11e8-86dc-1d186de160c6.png)
which contains `m` for the slope of line, and point `(a,b)` for the point the line goes through.

Sometimes we only know the slope and an information of a point, so that can make us an linear equation too, simple like that.

Example:
Q: Write the point-slope equation of the line that passes through (7,3) whose slope is 2.
Solve:
As for the `point-slope form` of linear equation `y - b = m(x - a)`, we can rewrite it to:
```py
y - 3 = 2(x - 7)
```


# Forms of linear equation

- [Slope-intersect form](http://www.mathsisfun.com/equation_of_line.html): 
`y = mx + b`, which `m` as `slope`, b as `y-intersect`.
This form is good for graphing a line with y-intersect and a certain slope.

- [Slope-point form](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/line-equation-point-slope.html): 
`y - b = m(x - a)`, which `m` as `slope`, (a, b) as a point on the line.
This form is good for draw a line through one or two points.

- [Standard form](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/two-var-linear-equations/standard-form/a/standard-form-review): 
`Ax + By = C`, which A,B,C are all `integers`.
This form is good for graphing a line through both x and y intersects.


# [`Maxima` and `Minima` of Functions](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/functions-maxima-minima.html)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37450559-500bc090-2869-11e8-9c46-022e451d9369.png)

- `Absolute maximum`: means the **greatest** value of the function `f(x)`.
- `Absoute minimum`:  means the **least** value of function `f(x)`.
- `Relative maximum` or called `Local maximum`: means **the `top of a hill`** on the function's graph.
- `Relative minimum` or called `Local minimum`: means **the `bottom of a valley`** on the function's graph.


# `ARC`: Average rate of change
Mind that: it's very basic idea for `Differential calculus`.

- For non-linear function, it means the `Average slope` for a specified domain.
Because the slope is almost always changing in a non-linear function, and we have to specify a range or a domain then to get the average slope of this part of function.
- For a linear function, the `Average rate of change` just means the only one `slope`, which is constant.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37553819-f9f304a0-2a09-11e8-8d6b-8397e6439d9f.png)


For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37452589-fd81b21a-286f-11e8-9e47-08010021d4e5.png)

We specify a domain on x-axis that from 0 to 3, aka. [0,3]. To know the `average rate of change` or the `average slope`, we can just directly draw a line connecting two points, and get the slope of this line.

First to get the x's interval for [-3,-1].
Then we are to apply this equation to get `ARC`:

# [`Arithmetic Sequences`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/sequences/constructing-arithmetic-sequences/a/arithmetic-sequences-review)

In `arithmetic sequences`, there's a `common difference`, 
which means the difference between neighbour terms **is always the same**. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37459420-f0838440-2882-11e8-97d3-499a09cc6f04.png)

We can represent the sequence as a `formula`.
In the formula, we set the 1st term as `k`, and `common difference` as `d`.
There're two forms of formula to represent the sequence:
- [`Explicit form`: ](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/sequences/constructing-arithmetic-sequences/a/writing-explicit-formulas-for-arithmetic-sequences)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37459348-bbcd32b4-2882-11e8-9091-5b7c55edb45a.png)

# [`Geometric sequences`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/sequences/constructing-geometric-sequences/a/geometric-sequences-review)

Similar idea for `arithmetic sequences`, only it's multiplying a `common ratio` here for `geometric sequences`, instead of adding a common difference in arithmetic sequences.

The `common ratio` below is 2:

There're also two forms for geometric sequences' formula:

- `Explicit form`:

# [`Absolute value graphs` (transformation)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/absolute-value-equations-functions/graphs-of-absolute-value-functions/a/absolute-value-equations-and-graphs-review)

To understand this idea, need to review the previous knowledge of `Transformation` of graphs, including `translation`, `rotation`, `reflection`, `dilation`. Also need to know the `scale factor` of dilation.

For a simplest form of an `absolute value equation`, it can be represented as:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37503599-4d5cc546-2914-11e8-99bf-6ed565ef519c.png)
And the most common use for this idea, is in `Quadratic`:
`y=x²`

And the general form of an `absolute value equation`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37503248-3a72f948-2912-11e8-8f09-d2b55460eda8.png)
In the equation, 
- The sign of `a`, negative sign of `a` means the graph is **flipped** by `x-axis`.
- `a` is the `scale factor` of the graph, equals to `g'(x)÷g(x)`.
- `h` is distance of `moving right`, should be **subtracted** by `x`.
- `k` is distance of `moving up`, should be added by `y`.

Notice that:
The `h` is confusing sometime ---- 
it's the distance of **moving right**, 
and should be **subtracted** from `x`. 
Subtracted ,subtracted, subtracted!

# [`Linear growth` vs. `Exponential growth`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/introduction-to-exponential-functions/exponential-vs-linear-growth/v/exponential-vs-linear-growth)

Quite a bit like the `Arithmetic sequences` vs. `Geometric sequences`,

except in `Exponential relationship`, it's using a `common exponent`,
instead of using a `common ratio` in the `geometric sequences`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37510088-f048a00c-2934-11e8-9a9c-3189f90f241d.png)

The term `relationship` is applying to the value of `f(x)`, aka. the `y`. 
If each value of `y` could have a `constant gap`,  then the function `f(x)` has a linear relationship.
If each value of `y` could have a `constant ratio` or `constant exponent`, then the function `f(x)` has a exponential relationship.

> Each time we add a side (triangle to quadrilateral, quadrilateral to pentagon, etc), we add another 180° to the total

So the `sum of interior angles` of a 2D shape is shown below:
- Any Polygon: `(n-2)×180°`
- Ray: 0°
- Triangle: 180°
- Quadrilateral: 360°
- Pentagon: 540°
- Hexagon: 720°
- Septagon: 900°
- Octagon: 1080°
- Nonagon: 1260°

> In a `regular polygon`, which means all interior angles have same measure, each angle equals to `sum ÷ n`.

For example, in a 3-sides triangle, if it's a regular triangle, aka. `equilateral triangle`, each angle should be `180°/3`, which is 60°.

# [`Function Transformations`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/function-transformations.html)

> Express different transformations in the function.

Refer to the previous note [Graph transformations](https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/44#issuecomment-371067923).

Let's assume:
- the function is `f(x) = x^2` (it could be any other function instead).
- and the **transformed** new function is `g(x)`.

## `Translation` (Shift)

```javascript
g(x) = f(x) + C
```
- If `C` is positive, the graph of `f(x)` moves **UP**.
- If `C` is negative, the graph of `f(x)` moves **DOWN**.

```javascript
g(x) = f(x+C)
```
- If `C` is positive, the graph of `f(x)` moves **LEFT**.
- If `C` is negative, the graph of `f(x)` moves **RIGHT**.

## `Reflection` (Flip/Mirror)

- Reflect the graph about the `x-axis` (Mirror it upside down, or downside up).
```javascript
g(x) = -f(x)
```

- Reflect the graph about the `y-axis` (Mirror the graph left to right, or right to left)
```javascript
g(x) = f(-x)
```

## `Dilation` (Scale/Stretch/Compress)
> Stretching the graph when `C` bigger than 1, compress it when `C` less than 1.

- Scale the graph about the `y-axis` (Vertically stretch or compress)
```javascript
g(x) = C・f(x)
```

- Scale the graph about the `x-axis` (Horizontally stretch or compress).
```javascript
g(x) = f(C・x)
```

# [`Inverse functions`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/function-inverse.html)

> If a `function` means `Map to`, then `inverse function` means `Map back`. `f(x)=y` maps `x` to `y`, then `f'(y)=x` maps `y` back to `x`. Note that `f'` is the inverse function of `f`.

[Khan notes.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/manipulating-functions/verifying-that-functions-are-inverses/a/verifying-inverse-functions-by-composition)

When we have a function, it means we have a `mapping rule`. In this rule, we can map `x` to `y`, expressed as `f(x) = y`. But if we know `y`, how can we map back to `x`? 


## [Identify inverse functions by composition](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/manipulating-functions/verifying-that-functions-are-inverses/a/verifying-inverse-functions-by-composition)

> To verify two functions are inverse, we can compose them.

If `f(g(x))` = `g(f(x))`, then they are inverse.

## [`invertible functions`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/manipulating-functions/invertible-functions/a/intro-to-invertible-functions)

> Not all functions have inverses. Those who do are called "invertible."

If a function `f(x)` maps `x` to `y`, and another function `f'(y)` can help us mapping `y` back to `x`, 
then the function `f(x)` is `INVERTIBLE`. 
If not, then it is NOT invertible.

### `Horizontal line test`
On the graph of function `f(x)`, if we can draw a `horizontal line` and ends up touches the graph **more than once**, we could say the function is **NOT INVERTIBLE**.

# [`Polynomial long division`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_long_division)

> It's very import to understand it in the first place. Once get the idea, it's easy to solve this problem.

First need to understand, 
this usually is a **`Degrading process`**.

For instance, we don't need to divide `7/13` or `2/3`, 
because the `numerator` is lower than the `dominator`. 
But we could divide `20/7` to `2 6/7`, and the `6/7` is the `remainder`.

In `polynomials division`, we don't compare the value of them, 
but we could compare the `degrees` of both parts. 
`Higher one` CAN BE divided by a `lower one`, 
and probably left over a `remainder` that even lower than the `dominator`.


There're a few main ideas act in the division process:
- `Numerator`: This polynomial usually has `higher degrees`.
- `Dominator`: This polynomial (or monomial/binomial) usually `lower degrees`.
- `Remainder`: After the `degrading` all the `higher degree` terms, left some terms can't be lower than the `dominator`'s degree, we then stop here, and call it remainder.

A normal division: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37637509-27551d80-2c43-11e8-9b56-9709144ca232.png)

We can also write this division as below, which replace `R` with `+`, makes it more intuitive:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37637646-cf22d7e6-2c43-11e8-9b8c-4895571ab04d.png)

Same thing we can apply to the `polynomial division`, 
Assume that there's a division: 
```javascript
f(x) ÷ d(x) = q(x) with a remainder of r(x)
```
and we can rewrite it to:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37637592-938fa998-2c43-11e8-89ec-8379f04fee81.png)



Example: 
We got two polynomials need to be divided one by another, and we could represent it as below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37610168-e1de8868-2bd9-11e8-8386-825c8f47779b.png)

By multiplying `x²` to `(x-3)`, we could get `x³ − 3x²`, which could be use to `cancel out` it from the `numerator`, to `degrade` it. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37610365-5b89e81a-2bda-11e8-95e3-eda8abfe17f1.png)

After the first `degrading`, it gets a `lower degree polynomial`, 
and the `left over` is still `higher` than the dominator, 
so we can repeat the same process to do it again, 
until the `left over` is `zero` or lower than the `dominator`.

## [`The Remainder Theorem`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/polynomials-remainder-factor.html)

It has exact the same function of using Math notation `Σ`.


# [`Binomial theorem`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/binomial-theorem.html)

> It actually is a hard term to understand at beginning.  One way to do this, is to learn how to solve first, then learn what's the theory behind it.

For a binomial `(a+b)ⁿ`, we've tried to expand with 2nd degree, a quadratic.
But to expand it with higher degrees, like `(a+b)⁷`, 
it WON'T BE easy at all to multiply one by one by one. 

That's where the `Binomial theorem` comes to place.

[Math is fun.](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/binomial-theorem.html)
[Khan lecture: Expanding binomials w/o Pascal's triangle](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/polynomial-functions/binomial-theorem/v/binomial-expansion-algorithm)

> All `binomials (a+b)ⁿ` follow this theorem.

## How to solve 
> It's even easier to learn how to solve first than how to understand.

For a given binomial `(a+b)ⁿ`, let's say it's `(a+b)³`, to expand it
1. List **(n+1)** `base terms`:
```py
ab + ab + ab + ab
```
Notice that, **every base is the same: `ab`, and there're amount of `n+1` terms**.

2. Add `exponents` to each factor of each base term:
```py
a³b⁰ + a²b¹ + a¹b² + a⁰b³
```

Notice that, exponents of `a` are always **degrading**, and of `b` are always **upgrading**.

3. Add `coefficient` the each term:
Here it is the MOST DIFFICULT part to understand. We could either find the coefficient from `The Pascal's Triangle`, or calculating the formula from `Binomial Theorem`.

> `Pascal's Triangle`. Just find the row has the same degrees with `n`, and pick up each number as coefficient:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37641475-d1603fec-2c54-11e8-86e6-49edeea7a5fd.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37643038-45c3af86-2c5a-11e8-89f9-e6d458e8e85c.png)


> **`Binomial theorem coefficient formula`**:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37641694-b253cb36-2c55-11e8-9be1-217458e70143.png)
It's called `n choose k`, what it represents it the `the term k of the Row n`.

In this case, `(3 choose 2)` the `2nd term in 3rd power row`, apply to the formula, we'll get `3`, which is exactly the same in the `Pascal's triangle`.

And let's list the coefficients in terms of `(n choose k)`:
```py
(³₀),  (³₁),  (³₂),  (³₃)
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37642598-b6742708-2c58-11e8-9fcc-e10adb85c10c.png)

And solve out each (n choose k), we get coefficients:
`1 , 3, 3, 1`

So the final result is:
`1a³b⁰ + 3a²b¹ + 3a¹b² + 1a⁰b³`

Simplify it to be:
`a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³`



It has to have understanding of [`factorial`](https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/44#issuecomment-374487125) and [`Combinations and Permutations`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/combinatorics/combinations-permutations.html) in order to understand this formula.

there are ONLY TWO `End behaviours` it will present.

Just to ignore the middle part of each 

**`Even degrees polynomial`** be like:

Further move,
the `negative even degrees polynomial` be like:

# [Even & odd functions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/polynomial-functions/symmetry-of-polynomial-functions/a/symmetry-of-polynomials)

It's about the `symmetry` of a function.
And the `line of symmetry` **HAS TO BE** either `y-axis` or the `origin`.

- If the function's graph is symmetry about the **`y-axis`**, we call it an **`Even Function`**,
and `f( -x ) = f( x )`.
- If the function's graph is symmetry about the **`origin`**, we call it an **`Odd Function`**,
and `f( -x ) = - f( x )`.

`Even function`:

# `Radical Equation`

Means an equation or an expression that has a square root, cube root, etc.
The symbol is `√`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37655915-839b1c8c-2c81-11e8-8074-2373179d0d8e.png)

> Whenever you raise both sides of an equation to an even power, you must check for extraneous solutions.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37957468-98678da8-31e0-11e8-804b-0a6dd6412a7c.png)
However, taking the square root of both sides of an equation does not introduce the possibility of extraneous solutions.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37957491-a8b51608-31e0-11e8-8a5f-50f5c2ffcb1a.png)

When you're to `square` something, you may LOOSE some information: the sign of the squared term.

So when you're solving a `radical equation`, you might need to take the root out of a `even exponent` number.
Since you lost the information about the `sign` of the term, you can't be sure it's **negative** or **positive**.
Here's the problem, If you didn't correctly guess the `sign`, the solution you got for the equation will be incorrect as well.
We call it **`Extraneous solution`**.

So every time you solve a radical equation, you have to examine each solution. 
Take them back to the equation and see if it works out.

## `Principal Square Root`
> Means the `Positive square root`.

When you say a square root of a number, you meant BOTH the positive and negative root.
But when you put a `√` sign before the number, it means you want a POSITIVE ROOT.
And you read it `Principal square root` of the number.

# [`Rational Expressions`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/rational-expression.html)

> Or called `Rational functions`. It's a `fraction of two polynomials`. And a fraction of two constant numbers will also be fine, because a polynomial could be a constant number.
We call the numerator the **`TOP`**, and the dominator the **`BOTTOM`**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37701515-40c118d6-2d2a-11e8-908b-cce3409adf2e.png)

## `End Behaviour` of rational functions

[Khan lecture.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/rational-expressions-equations-and-functions/end-behavior-of-rational-functions/v/end-behavior-of-rational-functions)

## [`Removable Discontinuity`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/rational-expressions-equations-and-functions/v/discontinuities-of-rational-functions)

> A function could have some `breaks`, makes `discontinuities` of the function. 
At this break, you could either draw a line called `vertical asymptote`, or have a `removable discontinuity`.

For example, `f(x) = 1/x`, the `x` MUSTN'T be `zero`, so the domain of this function is `all real numbers except 0`. So there's a `break` or a `discontinuity` of this function.

Another example,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37703200-d863682e-2d2f-11e8-8f21-accab0efc077.png)

We know that in the `dominator`, the `x` can't be `-6` or `-4` because the dominator mustn't be zero. And `-6 and -4` makes **`discontinuities`** of the function.

Further more, we could **CANCEL OUT** `(x+4)` from both numerator and dominator. 
And this makes `(x+4)` REMOVABLE, so that the `-4` become a **`Removable discontinuity`**.

Now what's left here is this fraction:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37703655-5f758580-2d31-11e8-9e94-823a77038bc8.png)

We see the `-6` still makes the whole function `undefined`, and makes `discontinuity`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37703811-d5408990-2d31-11e8-8cc0-bf1f5f830bfa.png)

So at the moment, we could DRAW a `vertical line` through the `-6` point, that the function could never touch.
So we call this line a **`vertical asymptote`**.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37703817-dd31f0f8-2d31-11e8-8dea-fc1d87d89e68.png)

> So for the conclusion, a solution for the `x` that makes the function `undefined`, 
it could either make a `vertical asymptote`, or a `removable discontinuity`.


> If the numerator and the denominator share either root exactly once, then fff will have a removable discontinuity at that root.

> If the denominator has multiple copies of either of the numerator's roots, then fff will have a vertical asymptote at that root.


# [`Asymptote` of Rational Expressions](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/asymptote.html)

> It's a **`straight line`** that some other curve line is tend to approach to, and never will touch.
It's a fairly important for the `rational expressions`.

They're going to be infinitely close but NEVER end up together.

Types of `asymptotes`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37701885-a430d630-2d2b-11e8-969e-9bf9f7d32297.png)

The `direction of asymptote` could go another way around as well:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37701893-a95691b8-2d2b-11e8-8b52-fc21a8668172.png)

> The `asymptote` only make sense to the `Rational Expressions`.

## Amount of `asymptotes`

A `rational express` could have multiple asymptotes, but following these rules:
- **ANY** amount of `vertical asymptotes`
- at most **ONE** `horizontal asymptote` or **ONE** `oblique asymptote`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37701944-e62e5184-2d2b-11e8-99fb-119af6796ef8.png)

### Finding `Vertical Asymptotes`
> It's fairly easy. And there could be multiple numbers of that.

Just simplify the fraction of polynomials, and look at the BOTTOM part, 
find EACH value of `x` makes the `dominator` as `undefined`, 
and you can draw a VERTICAL LINE through each `x` value, that would become a `Vertical asymptote`.

### Finding `Horizontal asymptote` and `Oblique/Slant asymptote`
> It depends on the `degree` of the `top` vs `bottom` polynomial.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40049051-45773d08-5866-11e8-8beb-c81deacd4b91.png)

There're FOUR possible cases need to discuss differently:

- Degree: Top < Bottom. (e.g., x² and x⁵)
The `Horizontal asymptote` is `y = 0`.

- Degree: Top = Bottom. (e.g., x² and x²)
The `Horizontal asymptote` is `y = (c1 / c2)`. (`c` means coefficient)
`c1` is the **`Leading Coefficient`** of the Top , the `c2` is the bottom's. 
`Leading coefficient` is of the term of polynomial that has highest degree.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37706442-80b53a16-2d3a-11e8-9f46-e5d4e25bdec5.png)

- Degree: Top > 1 + Bottom. (e.g., x⁵ and x²)
There is no horizontal nor oblique asymptote in this case.

- Degree: Top = 1 + Bottom. (e.g., x² and x³)
The `Oblique/Slant asymptote` is `y = p1 / p2` (p means Polynomial)
It only gets the `Oblique asymptote`, instead of horizontal one.
Divide `Top polynomial` by `Bottom polynomial` by using `Polynomial Long Division`,
**IGNORE** the `remainder`.

For example, the rational function is `f(x) = (3x²+1)/(4x+1)`, and we do long division:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37707586-96149182-2d3e-11e8-84bf-adf5f8406991.png)


Ignore the remainder, we gets the `Oblique asymptote` is `y = (3/4)x - (3/16)`





# `𝑒` as a limit

When you do this formula:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37762724-2076bbca-2df8-11e8-87b1-358a7fbca68e.png)


Whatever the `n` is, no matter how large `n` goes, 
the value of the formula will NOT go insanely big, it will only get closer and closer to the number `2.7...`.

So we call the number it is approaching as `𝑒`. And express the idea as below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37762842-6851ece4-2df8-11e8-9d57-9375a073943c.png)



# `Logarithm`

## `Euler's number ｅ`

The `Euler's number ｅ` actually came from the `Compound Interest`, for calculating the loan, the interest of money you borrowed.

We've known about `e` as a constant number as `π` is. But where does it come from? Here it is:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/40298137-9e034e0a-5d14-11e8-9731-5077fcd85b62.png)

Btw, you need to learn Calculus to understand this idea. It just simply means the `Loan rate` approaching to a number but never achieve.

[Refer to the lecture from Khan academy for Calculus course: 𝑒 and compound interest](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-derivatives-advanced/modal/v/e-through-compound-interest)
[Refer to the lecture from Khan academy for Calculus course: 𝑒 as a limit](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-derivatives-advanced/modal/v/e-as-limit)

When you're counting how much do you need to pay the loan depends on how often (`n`) you will repay it, e.g. you will repay the loan "once a year", or "once a month", or "once a day". 

The rate WILL NOT going to boost to infinite but only approaching to `2.72` but always less than it.

The larger `n` is, the closer it is to `2.72`.

# Equations of `Circle`

> Definition of circle: The set of all points on a plane that are a fixed distance from a center.

[Maths is fun.](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/circle-equations.html)


## Standard Equation of circle
Since the definition of circle is the set of all points with same distance to the center,
so we assume any point `(x, y)` on this circle can satisfy this equation:
```py
x² + y² = r²
```

The circle with shift, then it could be like below:
```py
(x - a)² + (y - b)² = r²
```
> It comes straight out of the `Pythagorean theorem` for triangle, that for any point `(x, y)` on the circle has centre at `(a, b)`, to calculate the radius `r`, that equation above is true.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37862184-bb8aaf72-2f83-11e8-9ef5-837b04f28662.png)

For example, this is a standard equation for circle:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37862118-c5c0a524-2f82-11e8-950a-398602c0eb75.png)

We can eyeball it out, the **CENTER** is `(5.2, -3.7)`, and **RADIUS** is √49, aka. `7`.

## General form of equation of circle
> it's also called `expanded equation for circle`.

```py
x² + y² + Ax + By + C = 0
```





# `π` (pi) Where does it come from

```py
π = Circumference / Diameter
```

That's why, when you do `dπ` or `2πr`, you will get a `π`, it's progress of getting it back.


# `Radians`
> It's another measurement method for an angle in a circle.

[Maths is fun.](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/radians.html)

We set an arc that its length is equal to the `radius`, we call this angle `a Radian`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37863241-fb4db64c-2f95-11e8-9d2e-0df6f0e225ac.png)

So, for this measurement, **how many `radians` are in a full circle?**
Just to do `Circumference / Radius`, and we'll get there're `2π` amounts of `radians` in a full circle.

## Conversion of `Radian` and `degree`
A full circle is `360°`, 
so we do `360° / 2π` to get `1 Radian` is equal to `180/π` degree. 
And vice versa, `1 Degree` is equal to `π/180` radian.
There're some examples:
```py
π radians = 180°
2π radians = 360°
0.5π radians = 90°

# Radian =>> Degree
17/18 π radians = (17/18) * 180° = 170°
3 radians = 3 * (180°/π) = 540/π degrees

# Degree =>> Radian
18° = 18° * (π/180) = 0.1π
```

Every period of `sine wave` is a whole unit circle:

## `Sinusoidal graphs`

[Math is fun: Graphs of Sine, Cosine and Tangent.](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-sin-cos-tan-graphs.html)
[Symbolab example.](https://www.symbolab.com/solver/step-by-step/shift%20y%3Dsin%5Cleft(2x%2B3%5Cright)%2B10)

Graph of `unit sine & cosine function`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37892104-3cf453c0-3109-11e8-87a9-3775f21b1397.png)


## `Midline, amplitude and period` 
> They're three features of `sinusoidal graphs`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/37882310-d5f0280e-30d4-11e8-9674-8c89253ce49f.png)

- `Midline`: is the **horizontal line** that passes exactly in the **middle** between the graph's **maximum** and **minimum** points.
- `Amplitude`: is the **vertical distance** between the **midline** and one of the **extremum points**.
- `Period`: Also called `frequency`, is the **distance** between **two consecutive maximum points**, or two consecutive minimum points (these distances must be equal).

## `Initial period` and how to graph a sinusoidal function
> To graph the whole function, you only need 1 period of the graph, and then just repeat that ever and ever.
And to avoid any confusion, we'd pick the `initial period`, which:
- `sin(x)` that interval is [0,2π], and looks like an `S`. Y-intersect at its midline.
- `cos(x)` that interval is [0,2π], and looks like a `Bow`. Y-intersect at its peak.

You really need to pay attention for the `starting point` of the `S` and the `bow`, it's the great way to figure out the how much the graph shifted on x-axis.

The necessary information to draw the `initial period` :
- Any two of the three position: Max, Min and Midline
- Period
- Phase shift from `initial point`

With these information above, we could figure out all other informations about the period.

### `Initial period of sin(x)`:

> Looks like a `flipped S`.

`Starting point` of the `flipped S` is its **`Midpoint`**, at `(0,0)`, 
`Full period` is `2π`, `Midline` at `y=0`, `Range` is `[1,-1]`.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38128547-97acc21c-342d-11e8-8fce-9668f6872c32.png)

### `Initial period of cos(x)`:

> Looks like a `bow`.

 `Starting point` of the `bow` is its **`Peak`**,   at `(0,1)`, 
`Full period` is `2π`, `Midline` at `y=0`, `Range` is `[1,-1]`.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38128681-21d19436-342e-11e8-957f-a502ec4ee8d8.png)


## `Phase shift of trig functions`
> `Phase shift` means horizontal shift, or moves on x-axis. It's much harder to understand and calculate than the vertical shift.

Since trig functions(sine, cosine, tangent) are all periodic functions, so it's really CONFUSING with horizontal moving, because it's repeating, and you can't easily tell what happened with the graph.

### Calculate algebraically how much is the Phase Shift
First need to figure out the `starting point` of the `initial period`, and to compare how much it moved from 0 on x-axis.

[Youtube tutorial: How do you determine the phase shifts for sine and cosine graphs](https://youtu.be/eiZCk-A6qVw?t=5m17s)
[Youtube tutorial : Sine Function Phase Shift](https://youtu.be/HHbbi1G_Y4k?t=4m29s)

Since the `initial period` of both sine and cosine functions starts from `0 on x-axis`,
with the formula of function `y = A*sin(Bx+C)+D`,

> we are to set the `(Bx+c) = 0`, and solve for `x`, 

the value of `x` is the phase shift of the graph.

Why do we set `(Bx+c) = 0`?
Because we could imagine the `(Bx+c)` is a whole, and could be `w` of the `sin(w)`.
Since the `initial period` of `sin(w)`, always starts from `0`,
we could say the `starting point of initial period` is `0`, so `w=0`, then `Bx+C=0`.

## `Peak points` (Max & Min)
> Let's call the **`INITIAL PEAKS`**, which is the `peaks` of the `initial period` .

Y-axis position of ALL peaks could be found in the function's **`Range`**, which could also be express as `[Max, Min]` or `[Min, Max]`.
Y-axis position of `Initial peaks`:`[-1, 1]`
or
Y-axis position of `all peaks`:
- Max: `y= Midline_position + Amplitude`
- Min: `y = Midline_position - Amplitude`

[Refer to the step-by-step solution at Symbolab.](https://www.symbolab.com/solver/step-by-step/range%20f%5Cleft(x%5Cright)%3D2sin%5Cleft(2x%2B3%5Cright)%2B5)

X-axis position of `Initial peaks`:
- sin(x):
    - Max: `x=π/2`
    - Min: `x=3π/2`
- cos(x):
    - Max: `x=0`
    - Min: `x=π`

To get the `x position` of these peak points, need to consider the `Phase shift` issue:
1. Whatever in the `sin(...)`, just assume it is standard function `sin(u)`.
2. Match the `x position` of standard function, e.g. `sin(u)` is at Max when `u=π/2`.
3. Solve the equation of `u` to get `x position`, e.g. `sin(2x+3)`, set `2x+3 = π/2` to get `x`.
4. `x` is the `x position` of the peak point of the `initial period`.

### How to find peak points of any period
The Y-axis position of peak points are maintaining **THE SAME** as the period repeats.
The X-axis position of peak points of the number `n` period is:
```py
Initial_peak + n*(Period_length)
```

Example:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38143668-27bad4ac-3474-11e8-8c61-c71f6e4442ea.png)
**Find the value of `t` when it's at the function's lowest point.**
Solve:
- `Max point` of `-sin(u)` is the `Min point`.
- X-position of the function at Initial Period is `u=π/2`
- Solve the equation `u=π/2` to get `t`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38143846-e40a736a-3474-11e8-9161-844bb7011675.png)


## Informations of Sinusoidal functions

For the `General sinusoidal function`:
```py
f(x) = A・sin(Bx + C) + D
```
- `Amplitude`: **|A|**
- `Period`: **|2π / B|**
- `Vertical shift`: **D**
- `Midline`: **y=D**
- `Range`: **[-A+D, A+D]**
- `Phase shift`: Set `(Bx+C)=0`, and solve for `x`.
- `Sign of function`: is the SAME sign of the slope of the **ORIGINAL** function's Y-intersect point.

Example:
```
f(x) = - 2sin(2x + 3) + 10
```
- Amplitude: |-2| = 2
- Period: |2π / 2| = π
- Vertical shift: +10
- Midline: y=10
- Range: `[2+10, -2+10]` = [12, 8]
- Horizontal shift: set `2x+3=0`, get `x=-3/2`, so it's shifting `-3/2` from origin.

Example 2:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38131750-ce7caed0-343a-11e8-8950-ecc2b3f2ef58.png)
Solve:
- Midline: `y=2.5`
- Amplitude: `|6-2.5|=3.5`
- Period: Midpoint to Max is 1/4 period, so `1/4 * 2π/B = |-4π - (-5/2)π|`, solve for B gets `1/3`.
- Phase shift: `-4π`. Because the `midpoint` on the left is the `starting point of initial period`

At this moment, our formula is almost finished:
`y = 3.5*sin(1/3 *x +C) +2.5`, so only the `C` is not yet solved.
set `1/3 *x + C = 0`, since , since `-4π` is the `phase shift`, so we set `x=-4π`, solve C gets `4π/3`.


# Trig values of `special angles`
> `Trig values` refer to Trigonometric values such as `Sine/Cosine/Tangent values`.
`Special angles` refer to **0°, 30°, 45°, 60°** 

[Easier way: refer to `unit circle`.](https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/44#issuecomment-377953990)

The follow are to remember in mind:

- `0°` (or `0 Radians`):
```py
sin(0°) = 0
cos(0°) = 1
```
- `30°` (or `π/6 Radians`):
```py
sin(30°) = cos(60°) = 1/2
cos(30°) = sin(60°) = √3/2
```
- `45°` (or `π/4 Radians`):
```py
sin(45°) = cos(45°) = √2/2
```
- `60°` (or `π/3 Radians`):
```py
sin(60°) = cos(30°) = √3/2
cos(60°) = sin(30°) = 1/2
```

## `Trig Identities`
Definition as below:

```py
sin(θ) = - sin(-θ)
cos(θ) = + cos(-θ)

sin(θ) = - sin(360° - θ)
cos(θ) = + cos(360° - θ)

sin(θ) = + sin(180° - θ)
cos(θ) = - cos(180° - θ)

sin(θ) = - sin(180° + θ)
cos(θ) = - cos(180° + θ)
```

Example, by using the identities, we could easily calculate a bunch of big angles:
```py
sin(315°) = sin(360° - 45°) = - sin(45°) = - √2/2
cos(315°) = cos(360° - 45°) = cos(45°) = √2/2
```

# `Inverse Trig equations`
> Probably it's the most tricky and difficult topic throughout all High School Math.

Prerequisites:
- Unit circle
- Reference angle & Angle in standard position
- Inverse functions
- Radian & degree conversion
- Signs of trig functions

It asks you to solve a trig function like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38163541-e42b4b22-3527-11e8-8961-8103575bb7da.png)
Actually it's asking you to use `inverse trig function` skills.


## Multiple solutions for inverse trig function
> The most difficult part to understand is the multiple solutions. And not all are valid.

e.g. `sin⁻¹(1/2)` means, we know the sine value is `1/2`, and we'd like to get the `arc angle's measure`. But there're multiple `arc angles` could have the very SAME sine value: 
- Counter-clockwise: 30°, 150°
- Clockwise: -330°, -210°.

But for making the function valid, we have to make it to `1-INPUT-1-OUTPUT`.
So we are to filter them out and only keep one solution, by restrict the `angle's measure`.

The `angle's measure` in Sine function is restricted by **DOMAIN**, but in its inverse function, it became **RANGE**.

By filtering with the RANGE, we are to get a **`ONLY-ONE & MUST-ONLY-ONE`** answer.

### Principle value & Calculator
So after filtering out all other solutions, we have only ONE solution, we call it:
The **`Principle Value`** of inverse trig function,
which shows up in any `calculator` when you type it.

## `HOW TO GET ALL POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS`
- First to use a `CALCULATOR` to get the `principle value` as our `base solution`.
- Find the mirror solution of each trig function by `Trig symmetry identities`:
    - `sin(θ) = sin(π - θ)`, if θ is POSITIVE.
    - `sin(θ) = sin(-π - θ)`, if θ is NEGATIVE.
    - `cos(θ) = cos(-θ)`
    - `tan(θ) = tan(-π + θ)`, if θ is POSITIVE.
    - `tan(θ) = tan(π + θ)`, if θ is NEGATIVE.
- Add periodicity to the solution to represent all periodic solutions: `x = θ + 2πn`

#### Example: `sin(x) = 0.65` 
- Use `calculator` to do `arcsin(0.65)` and get principle value: `0.71 Rad`.
- Apply trig identity `sin(θ) = sin(π-θ)` to get the mirror solution: `arcsin(0.65) = π - arcsin(0.65)`, which'd be: `2.43 Rad`.
- With two solutions `0.71 Rad` and `2.43 Rad` and add periodicity, we'll get two full solutions:
    - `x = 0.71 + 2πn`
    - `x = 2.43 + 2πn`

#### Example: `sin(x) = −0.25` 
- Use `calculator` to do `arcsin(-0.25)` and get principle value: `-0.25 Rad`.
- Apply trig identity `sin(θ) = sin(-π-θ)` to get the mirror solution: `arcsin(-0.25) = -π - arcsin(-0.25)`, which'd be: `-2.89 Rad`.
- With two solutions `-0.25 Rad` and `3.39 Rad` and add periodicity, we'll get two full solutions:
    - `x = -0.25 + 2πn`
    - `x = -2.89 + 2πn`

#### Example: `cos(x) = −0.7`
- Use `calculator` to do `arccos(-0.7)` and get principle value: `2.35 Rad`.
- Apply trig identity `cos(θ) = cos(-θ)` to get the mirror solution: `arccos(-0.7) = - arcsin(-0.7)`, which'd be: `-2.35 Rad`.
- With two solutions `2.35 Rad` and `-2.35 Rad` and add periodicity, we'll get two full solutions:
    - `x = 2.35 + 2πn`
    - `x = -2.35 + 2πn`

#### Example: `cos(x)=0.4`
- Use `calculator` to do `arccos(0.4)` and get principle value: `1.16 Rad`.
- Apply trig identity `cos(θ) = cos(-θ)` to get the mirror solution: `arccos(0.4) = - arcsin(0.4)`, which'd be: `-1.16 Rad`.
- With two solutions `1.16 Rad` and `-1.16 Rad` and add periodicity, we'll get two full solutions:
    - `x = 1.16 + 2πn`
    - `x = -1.16 + 2πn`

## `Range of the inverse trig functions`
The range differs for each arc-function:
- `Arcsin(x)=θ`: -90° < θ < 90°,  means angle only exists in Q.1 and Q.4
- `Arccos(x)=θ`: 0° < θ < 180°,  means angle only exists in Q.1 and Q.2
- `Arctan(x)=θ`: -90° < θ < 90°,  means angle only exists in Q.1 and Q.4

Tricks:
> About the signs like `90` and `-90`, 
just to think about the **CLOCKWISE** and **COUNTER-CLOCKWISE**.


## `Special Value of trig function solving`
> With `special trig values`, we really don't need calculator at all, but only to look at the picture of Complete Unit Circle. Or not even that if you can remember it.

Notice: 
`The Complete Unit Circle` only shows `counter-clockwise` angle measures which means `ONLY POSITIVE ANGLES`, 
so you have to do your own math to get the `NEGATIVE ANGLES`, aka. `clockwise angle measures`.

#### Example: Solve `sin⁻¹(1/2)`
- By looking at the `unit circle`, we know there're multiple arc measures could get a sine value `1/2`, which are 30°, 150°, -210°, -330°.
- Filter out all others by the Range `[-90°, 90°]`, we will get 30° is the ONLY-ONE and MUST-ONLY-ONE answer.

#### Example: Solve `sin⁻¹(-1/2)`
- Look at the `unit circle`, we know the answer are 210°, 330°, -30°, -150°
- With filtering by range `[-90°, 90°]`, so `-30°` is the only answer.

#### Example: Solve `cos⁻¹(√2/2)`



## `Basic trig equations`
> Once you figure out how to solve the original functions solution, it's so easy with this basic one.
Step-by-step solutions are as below:
- **Simplify** the equation to `sin(θ)=??` form.
- Solve θ with TWO solutions in the form of `θ = ?? + 2πn`.
- Replace `θ` with the expression of `x` and solve the equation for `x`.

[Khan practice.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry/trig-equations-and-identities/modal/e/solve-advanced-sinusoidal-equations)

Example: Solve `20sin(10x) − 10 = 5`
- Simplify the equation and get `sin(θ) = 3/4`
- Solve `sin(θ) = 3/4` get solutions for  is: `θ = 0.85 + 2πn` and `θ = 2.29 + 2πn`
- Replace θ with expression of x, which make `10x = 0.85 + 2πn` and `10x = 2.29 + 2πn`
- Solve equations for x, get `x = 0.085 + 0.2πn` and `x = 0.229 + 0.2πn`

## Composition of Inverse trig functions

## `Reference Angle`
> The notion `reference angle` would be the **very FIRST thing** to understand before solving any trig equations.

First thing first, it's always the angel with `X-axis` and `Terminal Ray`.

What is it for:
In trigonometry, if angles have the same `reference angle`, then they do have the **SAME** trig function values.
e.g. `sin(x) = sin(π-x)`, 
`cos(x) = cos(2π-x)`.

Features of a `reference angle`:
- It's always **LESS THAN** 90°.
- It's always **POSITIVE**.
- It's always the angle between the Side and the **X-axis**.

How to get the reference angle  θ:
- Quadrant I:  `θ`
- Quadrant II: `π - θ`
- Quadrant III: `θ - π`
- Quadrant IV: `2π - θ`



## `Angles in Standard Position`
> Regard to the `reference angle`, the `angles in standard position` means the ORIGINAL angle.

e.g. There's an angle `θ = 330°`. So `330°` is the `angle in standard position`, and `30°` is its `reference angle`.

Tricks:
> To imagine a Diving Athlete finished a ROLLING before hits water, she rolled may be 2 rounds, aka. 720°, and she made a 45° angle with her body and the surface of water.


## `Reference Triangles`
> A `reference triangle` is formed by "dropping" a **PERPENDICULAR** line from the `terminal ray` of a `standard position angle` to the X-axis. Remember, it must be drawn to the `x-axis`.

[Math is fun.](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Algebra2/TrigConcepts/TCReferenceTriangles.html)



## `Signs` of trig functions
> Before solving a trig equation, need look at the `sign` of the equation, AND identify which one or multiple `quadrants` will the solutions land in. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38201516-2c806e44-36cb-11e8-9e3a-376259a4c896.png)

- `Quadrant I`: All trig functions are **POSITIVE**.
- `Quadrant II`: Only `sin(x)` is **POSITIVE**, others are all NEGATIVE.
- `Quadrant III`: Only `tan(x)` is **POSITIVE**, others are all NEGATIVE.
- `Quadrant IV`: Only `cos(x)` is **POSITIVE**, others are all NEGATIVE.

e.g.
`sin(x) = 123` have a positive sign, so it will have two solutions: one in `Quadrant I`, another be `Quadrant II`.
`-cos(2x+3)=234`have a negative sign, so it'll have two solutions in `Quadrant II` and `Quadrant III`.

Tricks:
In a `unit circle`, `X-axis` could be represented by `sine`, `Y-axis` by `cosine`.
So just think how `x` and `y` will be positive and negative in each quadrant will give you the answer.
Btw, `tangent` is equal to `sin(x)/cos(x)`, so it's easy to guess its sign too.


# `Unit circle`
> It's a fairly **fundamental** tool for solving `trigonometric problems`.

[Refer to CalcWorkshop.](https://calcworkshop.com/radian-measure/unit-circle/)

"Unit Circle is nothing more than a circle with a bunch of **Special Right Triangles.**"

Well, these special right triangles help us in connecting everything we’ve learned so far about Reference Angles, Reference Triangles, and Trigonometric Functions, and puts them all together in one nice happy circle and allow us to find angles and lengths quickly.

## `Special right triangles`

## How to memorise the Unit Circle

[Refer to this PDF: unit-circle-radian-measure.pdf](https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/files/1868499/unit-circle-radian-measure.pdf)

> Actually, we only need to remember the First Quadrant, and just REFLECT it about Y-axis and X-axis and the Origin, then we get all four quadrants of these special values.

Something important to remember:
- Each point on the `unit circle`, has other THREE `images` on the unit circle, so in total it's FOUR of them. Two are POSITIVE, other two are NEGATIVE.

# `Average` in STATS
> `Average` in statistics means bit different than just a arithmetic average.

[Khan lecture.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/data-distributions-a1/summarizing-center-distributions/v/mean-median-and-mode)

`Average`: In stats, it means `typical` or `middle`, and could be represented by multiple ways:
- `Arithmetic mean`: Sum numbers and get average.
- `Median`: Sort numbers and get the MIDDLE one.
- `Mode`: A number repeats the most times in a dataset.


# `Empirical rule` (STATS)
> It's a rule describing a `Normal Distribution`.

It's also called the **`68-95-99.7% rule`**, because for a `normal distribution`:
- ≈68% of the data falls within 111 standard deviation of the mean
- ≈95% of the data falls within 222 standard deviations of the mean
- ≈99.7% of the data falls within 333 standard deviations of the mean

# `Permutations & Combinations` (PROBABILITY)
> Aside from probability, `Permutations` and `Combinations` are essential tools for statistics.

They're to solve the problem: `how many groups are there of if we choose some from some.`

[Jump back to previous note: `Intro to probability`.](https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/issues/44#issuecomment-372205396)

**HOW MANY** `groups` do we get if we choose a number things from the total things?
e.g., `how many groups would there be if we choose 3 people from 9 people?`

Permutations and combinations are both to count `the total number of groups`. 
We got TWO types of ways to count:
- Permutation: If the order in the group matters.
- Combination: If the order doesn't matter.

Combinations could be seen as **`FILTERED permutations`**, which filtered out all the "duplicates", or "over counted items".

e.g., We got different groups(Permutations) as "123, 132, 231, 213, 312, 321", once we filter out the over counted items, 
the `combination` is just one: `123`.

[Refer to web article.](http://www.fairlynerdy.com/permutations_and_combinations_simplified/)

## `Permutations`
> It's literarily saying the `possibilities`. 

Notice: `possibilities` ≠ `probabilities`

e.g., the `possibilities` of how to arrange three numbers 1,2,3?
It could be: `123, 132, 231, 213, 312, 321`, so answer is `6 possible ways`.
To count that algebraically, it'd be `3*2*1`, answer is `6 possible ways`.

How do we do this?

Possible ways to fit in the 1st position are 3, and we got 2 **left overs**. Then the 2nd place could have 2 possible ways, and we got 1 **left over**. So the 3rd position could be 1 possible way.

And just to logically think about it, we should MULTIPLY them together to get ALL POSSIBLE WAYS: `3*2*1`.

## `Combinations`

# `Ellipse` and its equation
> `Ellipse` is twisted circle, it got major features and equation from circle.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38452202-00ba82e0-3a72-11e8-8dfc-7558e520fdcb.png)

Ellipse got **TWO** radiuses (or radii):
- `Major radius`: the longer one.
- `Minor radius`: the shorter one.

## `Standard ellipse equation`
`a, b` is the radius on x-axis and y-axis. Ellipse originally centred at `(0, 0)`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38452253-e1771816-3a72-11e8-9270-b8d6dc209e4e.png)

## `Foci of ellipse`
Since ellipse is part of `Conic section`, so it has the same identity:

There're **TWO** points on the `Major radius` of ellipse, so that any point on this ellipse has the same sum of distance to both points. These two points are called `Focuses` or `Foci`.

###  `How to find the Foci`
- Major radius on X-axis: `f² = a²-b²`
- Major radius on Y-axis: `f² = b²-a²`

### Foci identity
With the distance `D₁ and D₂`, their sum is equal to `Double Major Radius`:
```py
D₁ + D₂ = 2*r
```




# `Hyperbola and its equation`

[Refer to Maths is fun.](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/hyperbola.html)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38454771-1d5da084-3aa0-11e8-898b-d3a7caac3f3d.png)

`Hyperbola` can be defined as a `curve` where the `distances of any point` from:
- A point (the focus)
- A (the directrix) are always in the same ratio.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38454869-e56e0946-3aa1-11e8-92e3-30e7f03fd991.png)


## `Equation of Hyperbola`

> Equation of hyperbola opens on the **`X-axis`**:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38456575-8129bef0-3ab8-11e8-9659-edb70efcc601.png)

> Equation of hyperbola opens on the **`Y-axis`**:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38457610-7951ff32-3ac5-11e8-90f4-029b8e68a0f1.png)

Features:
- Two vertices: 
    - `(±a, 0)` when it opens on x-axis.
    - `(0, ±b)` when it opens on y-axis.
- Two asymptotes: 
    - `y = (b/a)x`
    - `y = −(b/a)x`


## `Foci of hyperbola`
> Any point `P` on the hyperbola to both focuses 

```py
|D₁ + D₂| = CONSTANT
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38454841-5a60935a-3aa1-11e8-853a-27fd1929742d.png)

### How to find foci of hyperbola

```py
f² = a² + b²
```
`f` is the `focal length`, which is the distance from the focus to the centre.
`a` is the distance from the vertex to the centre, when the vertices are on **X-axis**.
`b` is the distance from the vertex to the centre, when the vertices are on **Y-axis**.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38456793-17313b1a-3abb-11e8-9918-a6240655e049.png)


### Example
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38743956-13ad2da2-3f73-11e8-9e6c-712084f409b4.png)
Solve:
- Its centre is at `origin`, so the unknowns are `x² & y²`.
- According to its vertices, the hyperbola opens `Up & Down`.
- Since it's up&down, the formula is `y²/b² - x²/a² = 1`.
- And the `b² = √(6)² = 6`
- According to the `foci equation`: then it should be `74 = a² + 6`, and `a² = 68`.
- So the equation would be `y²/6 - x²/68 = 1`


# Complex numbers

### `Imaginary number`

```py
# Assume that
i² = −1
# therefore the imaginary unit is
i = √(-1)
```

The pattern is from `i to i⁴`, then it repeats.
To evaluate `iⁿ`, just to get the remainder `n % 4` and see which term it is in the pattern. e.g., `i¹⁰` is equal to `-1` because `10 % 4 = 2` which is 2nd term in the pattern.


### `Complex Plane`

- `Rectangle form`
This form is good for plotting in the `complex plane`.
- `Polar form`
This form only refers to the `Absolute value` and `Angle`, 
which are also called the **`Modulus`** and the **`Argument`**.
- `Exponential form`
Its reasoning is too complicated, so just to remember it.
This form is very good for `complex number's` multiplication and division or further operations.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38483534-cbabf878-3c05-11e8-8e3d-d9a3392ce768.png)


## `Operations of complex numbers`

- `Multiplication`:

- `Division`: 
Need to use the notion `conjugates`

- `Powers`:
Better to convert it to `Exponential form` first, and do powers.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38488631-a44e6a3e-3c16-11e8-844b-66049dde3a00.png)



## `Convert between Rectangle form & Polar form`

**FORMS AND TECHNIQUES HERE, ARE RATHER APPLICABLE TO MANY TOPICS THAN MERELY FOR COMPLEX NUMBER. IT'S ACTUALLY FOR ALL TRIGONOMETRY RELATED TOPICS!!**

### `Absolute value of complex number`
> The `absolute value` of it literarily means the `DISTANCE` from the point of complex number to the `origin`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38489565-5cc48fce-3c19-11e8-91ef-2ff55a7774a5.png)

### How to understand this term?
**IT SPEND ME A LOT OF TIME TO UNDERSTAND AT THE FIRST TIME.**
In the example `5+6i`,
to calculate the absolute value of it `|5+6i|`, I know it's using the `Pythagorean theorem`.

But why it ISN'T doing `√(5²+6²i²)` instead of `√(5²+6²)`?
It is the most confusing part, and hard to consult the Internet with a clear answer that why do we **Take out** the `i` from calculating the distance.

The simple answer is that: 
No matter it's `i or i²`, it is either `√(-1) or -1`, in another word it actually is just a **NEGATIVE ONE**, 
but when we're counting a DISTANCE, it's always a POSITIVE, so we have to CANCEL OUT the `-1` from the number. That's the point we could ignore it when doing absolute value.

### `Angle of complex number`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38482352-6a396d9a-3c01-11e8-8514-0122196df3cd.png)

Note:
It only regards to the `tangent` knowledge of trig functions.
Better to review tangent identities to find all possible solutions of tan⁻¹(θ).
```py
tan(θ) = tan(-π + θ)
```

Steps:
- Find all solutions for angle θ.
- Plot rectangle form of complex number and figure out the `Quadrant`.
- Select the right solution at the right `quadrant`.

Example: Find angle for `z = −3 − 6i`
Solve:
- Principle solution: `θ = arctan(-6/-3) = 1.107` which is at 1st Quadrant.
- Another pair solution would be `-π + θ = -2.03` which is at 3rd Quadrant.
- `-3-6i` should be at the 3rd Quadrant in complex plane, so answer is `-2.03`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38483684-6f406c58-3c06-11e8-997f-baa6e17736dc.png)

For some exact values, we also need the `tangent values of unit circle`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38493202-eb7872c6-3c23-11e8-9c35-3fff654c54bf.png)



## `Convert between Exponential form & Polar form`
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/38491092-84926ac2-3c1d-11e8-8425-f35c54e6ad66.png)

Example: Find the solution of `z⁴ = -625` in Rectangle form and Polar form, which argument in [270°, 360°]
Solve: 
It's actually a process of conversion:
- `-625` could be represented as `-625 +0i` in Rectangle form
- Modulus `r` is `√(-625²+0²)` which is equal to `625`.
- `tanθ = 0/-625 = 0`, check the tangent unit circle table to know the angle could be `0° or 180°`, according to its rectangle form, it's certain to be on the negative X-axis, so it's `180°`.
- Add all possible solutions and get the angle is `180° + n*360°`.
- Polar form is: `625[cos(180° + n*360°) + i*sin(180° + n*360°)]`
- since the complex number is `z⁴`, so:
    - Modulus = `⁴√625 = 5`
    - Argument = `(180° + n*360°) / 4  = (45°+n*90)`
    - Range of argument is [270°, 360°], so the argument is `315°`
    - So the Polar form is: `5(cos315 + i*sin315)`.
    - Rectangle form is: `5√2/2 - i*5√2/2`
    


# Studies design (Statistics)

[Refer to Khan academy course.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/study-design-a1)

Types of studies:
- `Sample study`: To  estimate ONE certain parameter of a population.
- `Observational studies`: To **compare** TWO parameters of a population WITHOUT affecting them.
- `Experiments`: To compare TWO parameters of a population and DOES affecting one and does not affecting the other one.


## `Samples` or `surveys`
- Problem 1: Qualitative and quantitative data
- Problem 2: Representative samples
- Problem 3: Biased wording in survey questions
- Problem 4: Sampling methods
    - Systematic sampling: **100%** members of **ALL** groups chosen.
    - Stratified sampling: **Some** members from **ALL** groups chosen.
    - Random sampling: An adequate number of members chosen, each an equal chance of being in the sample.
    - Cluster sampling: **100%** members from **SOME** groups are chosen.

## `Observational studies` & `experiments`
- `Observational study`: Measure or survey members of a sample **WITHOUT** trying to affect them.
- `Controlled experiment`: **Apply** some treatment to one of the groups, while the other group **does not** receive the treatment.

## Notes
- Randomized experiments are designed to **`suggest causation`**
- `Correlation` is WEAKER than `causation`
- To answer a question about a causal relationship, we need to perform an experiment with a `treatment group` and a `control group`.
- While `sample study` need a part of relative members, `Observational study` need ALL members.

- Remember that a `trapezoid` has to have **TWO BASES** to be parallel.
- Know that, a `quadrilateral` CAN be inscribed in a circle or even a semicircle, which means 4 vertices  are all on the circle. 
- Since it's a `trapezoid`, and inscribed in a circle, then **IT HAS TO BE A ISOSCELES TRAPEZOID.** No matter its side crosses the centre or not.
