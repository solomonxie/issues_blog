# `Percentiles`
> Before start you probably need to know: explanations of `percentiles` are quite confusing and different from each teacher teaches and different at each website you searched. Because there is NO standard definition of percentile.

Percentiles tell you what PERCENTAGE of the population has a value that's **LOWER** than yours.

A `percentile` is all values **BELOW** the given percentage. etc., the `20th percentile` is all values below which 20% of the observations may be found.

> Percentiles are numbers from 1st to 100th, which 100th percentile means the largest value in the set.
According to wiki, there COULD be decimal percentiles such as 0.13th percentile, 2.28th percentile.

For example, if your doctor tells you: your height is AT the 83% **percentile** of population, it means there's 83% of people are shorter than or equal to yours:

## Other names of Percentiles

**`Interquartile`**:
- 25ᵗʰ percentile = Q1
- 50ᵗʰ percentile = Q2 = Median
- 75ᵗʰ percentile = Q3

**`Deciles`**:
Deciles are percentiles divided into 10 equal sections, which correspond to the 10th, 20th, 30th,...90th percentiles.

## `Percentile Rank`

`Percentile rank` is usually in a context of asking you to find a given value is at which percentile.
i.e., Percentile ranks are commonly used to clarify the interpretation of scores on standardized tests. 

> etc., you're asked what is the percentile rank of number 79 in a list, and the answer might be "Its rank is 90, because it's at the 90th percentile."

### Percentile vs. Percentile Rank

`Percentiles` and `Percentile Ranks` are highly similar(confusing) statistics. 
- `Percentiles` are used to determine where to draw the line between observed values within the distribution. 
(etc., a teacher wants to divide his class in half according to students' scores. And he needs to find out **which score** could be **AT** 50th percentile so that he can divide them.)
- `Percentile rank` is kind of **reversed** process: It is used to determine where a particular score or value fits within a broader distribution. 
(etc., A student receives a score of 75 out of 100 on an exam and wishes to determine which percentile he is at compares to the rest of the class. )

### Example

## `Calculating Percentiles`
The process of calculating percentiles, is actually **manipulating the indexes** of the number list. It's like calculating the **pointer**, finding out the right pointer will lead you to the number, regardless to what number it is.

There're a few methods for calculating percentiles:
- `Interquartile method`: For 25th = Q1, 50th = Q2 (or Median), 75th = Q3.
- `The nearest-rank method`: The most often used method.
- `The linear interpolation between closest ranks method`
- `The weighted percentile method`


### Example
There's a 12 numbers list, {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l}
then 80th percentile relates to 80% of the **AMOUNT** of the list, 
then it's `80% × 12 = 9.6` , which `9.6` is the **index** of the number in list.
But the **index** must be a whole number, 
so according to the definition of percentile, the number must be equal or above 80% of all values,
that's being said, the **index** of number is higher than "9.6", which is the `10th` number in list.
So the 10th number in list is AT the 80th percentile, regardless what number it is.

### Example
Consider the ordered list `{15, 20, 35, 40, 50}`, which contains 5 data values. What are the 5th, 30th, 40th, 50th and 100th percentiles of this list using the nearest-rank method?
