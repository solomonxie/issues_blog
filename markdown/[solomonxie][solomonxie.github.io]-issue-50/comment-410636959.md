# `Percentiles`
> Percentiles tell you what PERCENTAGE of the population has a value that's **LOWER** than yours.

[Refer to Khan academy: Calculating percentile](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/density-curves-normal-distribution-ap/modal/v/calculating-percentile)
[Refer to youtube: Percentiles - Introductory Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDJvDRvvDXo)

A `percentile` is all values **BELOW** the given percentage. etc., the `20th percentile` is all values below which 20% of the observations may be found.

> Percentiles are whole numbers from 1ˢᵗ to 99ᵗʰ, there's **NO** 0ᵗʰ or 100ᵗʰ or 89.99ᵗʰ percentile.

For example, if your doctor tells you: your height is AT the 83% **percentile** of population, it means there's 83% of people are shorter than or equal to yours:

For the Interquartile:
- 25ᵗʰ percentile = Q1
- 50ᵗʰ percentile = Q2 = Median
- 75ᵗʰ percentile = Q3


## `Percentile Rank`
`Percentile rank` is usually in a context of asking you to find a given value which percentile it is at.

> etc., you're asked which percentile the number 8 is at in a number list.
