# `Percentiles`
> Before start you probably need to know: explanations of `percentiles` are quite confusing and different from each teacher teaches and different at each website you searched.

Percentiles tell you what PERCENTAGE of the population has a value that's **LOWER** than yours.

A `percentile` is all values **BELOW** the given percentage. etc., the `20th percentile` is all values below which 20% of the observations may be found.

> Percentiles are whole numbers from 1st to 100th, there's **NO** 0th or 89.99th percentile, and 100th percentile means the largest value in the set.

For example, if your doctor tells you: your height is AT the 83% **percentile** of population, it means there's 83% of people are shorter than or equal to yours:

## Other names of Percentiles

**`Interquartile`**:
- 25ᵗʰ percentile = Q1
- 50ᵗʰ percentile = Q2 = Median
- 75ᵗʰ percentile = Q3

**`Deciles`**:
Deciles are percentiles divided into 10 equal sections, which correspond to the 10th, 20th, 30th,...90th percentiles.

## `Percentile Rank`

`Percentile rank` is usually in a context of asking you to find a given value is at which percentile.
i.e., Percentile ranks are commonly used to clarify the interpretation of scores on standardized tests. 

> etc., you're asked what is the percentile rank of number 79 in a list, and the answer might be "Its rank is 90, because it's at the 90th percentile."

### Percentile vs. Percentile Rank

`Percentiles` and `Percentile Ranks` are highly similar(confusing) statistics. 
- `Percentiles` are used to determine where to draw the line between observed values within the distribution. 
(etc., a teacher wants to divide his class in half according to students' scores. And he needs to find out **which score** could be **AT** 50th percentile so that he can divide them.)
- `Percentile rank` is kind of **reversed** process: It is used to determine where a particular score or value fits within a broader distribution. 
(etc., A student receives a score of 75 out of 100 on an exam and wishes to determine which percentile he is at compares to the rest of the class. )

## `Formula for Percentiles`

There're a few methods for calculating percentiles:
- `The nearest-rank method`: The most often used method.
- `The linear interpolation between closest ranks method`
- `The weighted percentile method`

### Example
Find the scores on 25th, 50th, 75th percentile.
Solve:
Just find the Q1, Q2(median), Q3 in the interquartile.
