# `Experiment Study`
RANDOMLY divide samples to a Control Group and a Treatment Group, and compare 2 groups of which one is AFFECTED and another one NOT AFFECTED.

The **purpose** is to build a **CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP**, which might tell you one even can cause another event, which `observational study` **can't** tell.

- Control group is the group **without** taking affects.
- Treatment group is the one will be having affects on.
