# `Experiment Study`
RANDOMLY divide samples to a Control Group and a Treatment Group, and compare 2 groups of which one is AFFECTED and another one NOT AFFECTED.

[Refer to Khan academy: Worked example identifying experiment](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/gathering-data-ap/modal/v/worked-example-identifying-experiment)

The **purpose** is to build a **CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP**, which might tell you one even can cause another event, which `observational study` **can't** tell.

The key is to divide two groups **randomly**, so that you will know how the affection really makes impact.

Two groups:
- Control group is the group **without** taking affects.
- Treatment group is the one will be having affects on.

## Conducting a Good Experiement
There're a few keys to conduct a good experiment:
- **Randomly** divide samples to two groups, to eliminate biases.
