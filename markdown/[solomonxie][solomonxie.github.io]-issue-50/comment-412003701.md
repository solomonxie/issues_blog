# `Experiment Study`
RANDOMLY divide samples to a Control Group and a Treatment Group, and compare 2 groups of which one is AFFECTED and another one NOT AFFECTED.

The **purpose** is to build a **CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP**, which might tell you one even can cause another event, which `observational study` **can't** tell.

The key is to divide two groups **randomly**, so that you will know how the affection really makes impact.

Two groups:
- Control group is the group **without** taking affects.
- Treatment group is the one will be having affects on.

## Conducting a Good Experiement
There're a few keys to conduct a good experiment:
- **Randomly** divide samples to two groups, to eliminate biases.
- It should be a **BLIND EXPERIMENT**, which all people don't know which group they're in.



## `Placebo Effect`
`Placebo` means "fake medicine", which made by sugar.
In drug testing and medical research, it's a very common way to test how **mentality** will affect the patient.

For conducting a medicine experiment, we randomly separate people to two groups:
- Control group: people will receive **placebo**.
- Treatment group: people will receive **real medicine**.


## `Blind Experiment & Double Blind Experiment`

- `Blind experiment`: All the observed people don't know which group they're in.
- `Double Blind Experiment`: Not only the observed people, but even the conductors/administers don't know which is which.
- `Triple Blind Experiment`: Even the people who analyze the data don't know which group they're analyzing.

It's a great way to avoid **BIAS**.


## `Improving Randomly Grouping`
Some times **complete randomness** will make things **uneven**, which raise the bias in experiment.
etc., there're more women in one group and less in another, that affects much in the result; there're more young people in one group, that affects much as well.

So for helping to adjust this situation well, we want to introduce some improvement design for **group strategy**:
- `Block Design`
- `Matched Pairs Design`: It is a special case of a **randomized** `block design`.

### `Block Design`

### `Matched Pairs Design` (Cross Over Trail?)
[Refer to Khan academy: Matched pairs experiment design](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/gathering-data-ap/modal/v/matched-pairs-experiment-design)

### `Matched Pair Trial Design`

It's simply just to "switch group", which after a period of time after the experiment to do the **second experiment**, that let the same people in Control Group switch to Experiment Group, and the other people switch as well.
