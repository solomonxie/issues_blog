# `Experiment Study`
RANDOMLY divide samples to a Control Group and a Treatment Group, and compare 2 groups of which one is AFFECTED and another one NOT AFFECTED.

The key is to divide two groups **randomly**, so that you will know how the affection really makes impact.

Two groups:
- Control group is the group **without** taking affects.
- Treatment group is the one will be having affects on.
