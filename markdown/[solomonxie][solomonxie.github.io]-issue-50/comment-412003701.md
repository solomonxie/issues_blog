# `Experiment Study`
RANDOMLY divide samples to a Control Group and a Treatment Group, and compare 2 groups of which one is AFFECTED and another one NOT AFFECTED.

The **purpose** is to build a **CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP**, which might tell you one even can cause another event, which `observational study` **can't** tell.

The key is to divide two groups **randomly**, so that you will know how the affection really makes impact.

Two groups:
- Control group is the group **without** taking affects.
- Treatment group is the one will be having affects on.

## Conducting a Good Experiement
There're a few keys to conduct a good experiment:
- **Randomly** divide samples to two groups, to eliminate biases.
- It should be a **BLIND EXPERIMENT**, which all people don't know which group they're in.



## `Placebo Effect`
`Placebo` means "fake medicine", which made by sugar.
In drug testing and medical research, it's a very common way to test how **mentality** will affect the patient.

For conducting a medicine experiment, we randomly separate people to two groups:
- Control group: people will receive **placebo**.
- Treatment group: people will receive **real medicine**.


## `Blind Experiment & Double Blind Experiment`

- `Blind experiment`: All the observed people don't know which group they're in.
- `Double Blind Experiment`: Not only the observed people, but even the conductors/administers don't know which is which.
- `Triple Blind Experiment`: Even the people who analyze the data don't know which group they're analyzing.

It's a great way to avoid **BIAS**.


## `Block Design`
