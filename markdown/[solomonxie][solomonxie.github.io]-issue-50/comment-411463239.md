## Linear & Non-linear Relationship
If you can fit **a** LINE through those points, it's **linear relationship**.
If not, then it's **non-linear**.


## Positive & Negative Relationship
If the scatterplot has a **linear relationship**:
- If the **slope** is positive, then it's **positive relationship**
- If the **slope** is negative, then it's **negative relationship**
