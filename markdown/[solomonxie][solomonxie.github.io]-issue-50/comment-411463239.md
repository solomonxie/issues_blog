# Scatter Plot

Just to plot many **dots** on the X-Y plane.

## Linear & Non-linear Relationship
If you can fit **a** LINE through those points, it's **linear relationship**.
If not, then it's **non-linear**.


## Positive & Negative Relationship
If the scatterplot has a **linear relationship**:
- If the **slope** is positive, then it's **positive relationship**
- If the **slope** is negative, then it's **negative relationship**


## `Bivariate relationship`: Linearity, Strength and Direction
> `Bivariate` is just a fancy way to say: for each x-point there's a corresponding y-point. etc., at point `(2,3)`, including x-point is 2 and y-point 3.
