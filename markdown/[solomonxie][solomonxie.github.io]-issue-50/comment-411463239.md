# Scatter Plot

Just to plot many **dots** on the X-Y plane.

## Linear & Non-linear Relationship
If you can fit **a** LINE through those points, it's **linear relationship**.
If not, then it's **non-linear**.


## Positive & Negative Relationship
If the scatterplot has a **linear relationship**:
- If the **slope** is positive, then it's **positive relationship**
- If the **slope** is negative, then it's **negative relationship**


## `Bivariate relationship`: Linearity, Strength and Direction
> `Bivariate` is just a fancy way to say: For analyzing each point in X-Y plane, we analyze x & y **separately**. 
etc., at point `(2,3)`, including x-position is 2 and y-position 3, we analyze the x-value of all points, and then y-value of all points.

## `Correlation Coefficient`
> It's kind like the **Unit SLOPE** of the estimated `Regression Line`, as letter `r`. 
`-1 ≤ r ≤ 1`, and `r=0` when there's NO **correlation** or `linear relationship`.
