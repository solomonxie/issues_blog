# `Bayes' Theorem`
> The Bayes' Theorem is a **revolution** to conditional probability.

**It does not intent to do once calculation, but is a progress of improving: each time gain a little bit more confidence.**

The formula of `Bayes' Theorem` is just a slightly extension to `Conditional Probability`.

How does it make sense?

â–² Probability of `A given B` and `B given A` has the same **numerator**, that's been said, 
**We can easily compute a `conditional probability` with its reversed event.**

In real life, sometimes `A given B` is easy to get, sometimes `B given A` is easier to get.
So whenever we encounter some difficulties of computing `A given B`, we can always use probability of `B given A` to compute.
