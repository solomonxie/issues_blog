# `Bayes' Theorem`
The formula of `Bayes' Theorem` is just a twist of `Conditional Probability`.

**The Bayes' Theorem does not intent to do once calculation, but is a progress of improving: each time gain a little bit more confidence.**

▲ Probability of `A given B` and `B given A` has the same **numerator**, that's been said, 
**We can easily compute one kind of event with another kind of event.**

In real life, sometimes `A given B` is easy to get, sometimes `B given A` is easier to get.
So whenever we encounter some difficulties of computing `A given B`, we can always use probability of `B given A` to compute.
