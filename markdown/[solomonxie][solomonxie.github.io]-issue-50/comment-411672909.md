# `R-Squared`
> `R-squared` means **squared residuals**, is also called `SE`, which is **Squared Errors**.

[Refer to Khan academy: R-squared or coefficient of determination](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/bivariate-data-ap/modal/v/r-squared-or-coefficient-of-determination)

(SE_line is `Squared Error from line`, )

- If `SE` (Squared-Error) from the line is **small**   ->   r² close to 1   ->  The line is a **good fit**.
- If `SE` (Squared-Error) from the line is **large**   ->   r² close to 0   ->    The line is **not** a good fit
