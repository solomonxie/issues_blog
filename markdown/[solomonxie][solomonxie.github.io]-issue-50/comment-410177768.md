## Shapes of distribution

[Refer to Khan academy: Classifying shapes of distributions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/quantitative-data-ap/modal/v/classifying-distributions)

- Symmetric distribution
- Left Skewed distribution
- Right Skewed distribution
- Bimodal distribution

## Centre of distribution

- Mean
- Median


## Spread of distribution

- Range: Simplest measure of range, which = (Highest value - Lowest value)
- IQR
- MAD
- ?


## Outliers of distribution
In statistics, an outlier is an observation point that is distant from other observations.
That being said, `outliers` in a graph are the **`MINORITY`** of the values.
