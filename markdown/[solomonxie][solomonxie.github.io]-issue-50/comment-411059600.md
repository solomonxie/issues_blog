# `Density Curves`

Some times `histograms` aren't good enough to visualize large amount of dataset. And `Density Curve` plot will solve the problem, as it can take on **any** value in a **continuum**, they're not just thrown into some buckets.

The entire **AREA** under the curve is **100%**, which represent all the data points.

The **percentage** of a interval of data points, is the **AREA** under the curve over the interval. NOT the height of a point.
