# `Linear Regression`
> Trying to fit a line as closely as possible, and as many of points as possible, is called "Linear Regression".

## `Residuals`
It is the **DISTANCE** from the actual value to the Regression Line.

For a given point at some X-value, the `residual` is:
`Residual = Y - Ŷ`
which Y is its **actual y value**, and Ŷ is the **y value on regression line**.

## `Least Squares Regression`
