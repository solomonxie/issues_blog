# `Z-score` (Standard Score / Normal Score)
> It's fairly important in real life: Japan use `Z-score` on exam to estimate each student's study skills.

`Z-score` is all about comparison: compare different kind of data set.
In another word, `Z-score` indicates **How many** `standard deviations` away (above or below) from the `mean` to the given point.

## Why do we need Z-scores
> "Z-scores in general allow us to compare things that are NOT in the same scale, as long as they are NORMALLY distributed." - CrashCourse


For example, although we know everyone's score, but by only watching those scores it's hard to know how good he is or how bad he is compare to anyone else in the dataset. etc., if most of the students score above 90, can we say someone scores 90 is good?

So `Z-score` gives a solution for this: compare the score to the "average".

`Z-score` is especially good to compare **different type of data**, etc., compare 100-score exam & 150-score exam, compare IELTS & TOFEL, compare apples & oranges, compare a baseball player & football player....

All in all, `Z-score` is a process of **`Normalization`**, which "normalize" different set of data to **same standard** and compare.

Compares the various grading methods in a normal distribution:

## How to understand the formula?

With comparing each one's score with the **mean**: `x - μ`, we will get a kind of `deviation`.

But at this point we still don't know whether each one's `deviation` is big or small.
We need a "standard" to compare each deviation.
Just like the `mean` is the **average** of all scores,
`standard deviation` is the **average** amount of deviation of all scores, which will tell us each deviation is large or not.
So we want to compare each `deviation` with the `Standard deviation`: `deviation ÷ 𝜎`

And we get the whole picture:
`Standard Score  = (𝓍 - μ) / 𝜎`

### How to understand the Number of Standard Deviations?

Assume the standard deviation is `𝜎`(sigma), so the number of it just means how much it is **scaled**.
etc., `2𝜎` means `a doubled standard deviation`, and `1.5𝜎` means `1.5 times larger SD`.
If your Z-score is `2𝜎`, it means your score is `doubled standard deviation away from the mean`.

### Example
There's some exam data of a class:

Here's their z-scores:

### Example
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/43770097-f359f7b4-9a6d-11e8-9616-c324da4bd6c2.png)
Solve:
- Isabella's z-score is: `(20-22)/5 = -0.4`
- Hannah's z-score is: `(33-38)/12.5 = -0.4`
- So they're equally young in their degree level.



## `Z-table` Conversion between Z-score & Percentile
> This ONLY applies to `Normal Distribution`

If you know someone's `z-score`, you will easily get his `percentile` from the `Z-table`.
Vice versa, if you know his `percentile`, you can get his `z-score` as well.

How to use?
The `1st Row` represent the `tenth decimal` of the `z-score`,
the `1st Column` represent the `hundredth decimal` of the `z-score`.
According to the given `z-score`, and search over the rows & columns to get the corresponded **intersection**, which is the `percentile`.

etc., someone's `z-sore` is "0.57", and you want to know what `percentile` he's at, or what proportion is below his score. 
Just go over to the `z-table`, first get to the row at `0.5`, and find the column of `0.7`, and the **intersection** will be his `percentile`, which is "0.7157" or "71.57%" in this case.
