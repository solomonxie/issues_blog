# `Empirical rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)`
> This rule **ONLY** applies to `Normal Distribution`.

It's also called the **`68-95-99.7% rule`**, because for a `normal distribution`:
- ≈68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean
- ≈95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean
- ≈99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean
