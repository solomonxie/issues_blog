# `Empirical rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)`
> This rule **ONLY** applies to `Normal Distribution`.

It's also called the **`68-95-99.7% rule`**, because for a `normal distribution`:
- ≈68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean
- ≈95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean
- ≈99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean

Solve:
- According to the `z-score` of point 32.2, `(32.2-20.5)/3.9=3` which is `3 standard deviations` away from the mean
- So by looking at the `empirical rule graph` or `Z-table` we know that's at `99.85th percentile`
- Hence the percentage **above** that value is `100% - 99.85% = 0.15%`
