`Two-way Table` is a **`Joint distribution`**, which **rows** represent a kind of distribution, **columns** represent another kind of distribution.

`Marginal Distribution` is simply an **addon** to the joint distribution, that as a `TOTAL` row or column at the margins.

`Conditional Distribution` is **one column(variable)** in condition of another variable.
