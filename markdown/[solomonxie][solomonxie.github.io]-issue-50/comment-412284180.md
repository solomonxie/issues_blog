## `Multiplication Rule` (A and B)
The probability of multiple events occur at the same time is the multiplication of their probabilities.

## `Addition Rule` (A or B)
The `A or B` probability is both of their favourable outcomes **minus** the **OVERLAPS** (common outcomes), which is `(A + B - C)`.
