# `Probability Rules`

## `Multiplication Rule` (A and B)
The probability of multiple events occur at the same time is the multiplication of their probabilities.

## `Addition Rule` (A or B)
The `A or B` probability is both of their favourable outcomes **minus** the **OVERLAPS** (common outcomes), which is `(A + B - C)`.
The formula is:
`P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)`.

## `Compound probability` (A then B)
> The problem "What's the probability of flipping coin to get 3 head in a row?" is a typical `Compound probability of independent events` problem.

The formula of `Compound probability of independent events` is the same with **multiplication rule**.

Example: Flipping a coin three times, what's the probability of getting a tail, head and tail ?
