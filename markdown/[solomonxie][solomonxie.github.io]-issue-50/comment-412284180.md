# Probability with Venn diagrams

## `Multiplication Rule` (A and B)
The probability of multiple events occur at the same time is the multiplication of their probabilities.

## `Addition Rule` (A or B)
The `A or B` probability is both of their favourable outcomes **minus** the **OVERLAPS** (common outcomes), which is `(A + B - C)`.
The formula is:
`P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)`.
