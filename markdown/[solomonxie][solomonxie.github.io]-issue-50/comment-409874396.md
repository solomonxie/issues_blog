[Khan lecture.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/data-distributions-a1/summarizing-center-distributions/v/mean-median-and-mode)

- `Mean number` is just an average of all numbers listed.
- `Median number` is the middle positioned number in a ordered `number set` (means no duplicates). If there're two middles, then average them to get a median number.
- `Mode number` is the number shows up most times in a list.
