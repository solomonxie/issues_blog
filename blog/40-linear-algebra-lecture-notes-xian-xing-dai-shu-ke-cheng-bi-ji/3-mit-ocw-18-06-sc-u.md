> "The fundamental problem of linear algebra is to solve n linear equations in `n` unknowns."

We view this problem in three ways:
- `Row picture`: Each row is an equation, and we could draw out each line equation on the graph.
- **`Column picture`**: Rewrite equations in the form below, and each column is a vector, and we could each vector (with scalar) on the graph.
- `Matrix picture`: Rewrite equations into `Coefficient Matrix form`, and see the geometric meaning of a matrix and vector.
