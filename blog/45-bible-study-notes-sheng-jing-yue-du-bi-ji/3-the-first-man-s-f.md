### Gen 3:1
> "Now" the serpent...
Q: `Now` emphasise the time moving or the nature of a living creature’s changing? 

> It’s more crafty than any other beast: 
Q: what’s the definition of `crafty` here? 
Is it sin, is it impurity or heart of hurting others ? 
Or it’s simply just a way to say cleverness?

> Q: Why didn’t the serpent **speak to man first**? 
Q: What would happen if it spoke to man first. 
Q: Did it ever talk to the man at all ?

### Gen 3:3
> Eva was citing God’s command and also add something new to it, which was coming from nowhere. 
That’s a very interesting thing to dig in. 
what would you say what was happening there referring to Eva's action? 
`Gossip`, is the original fault Eve made.
Could you say it's all serpent's fault?
Adding things to God's first rule, it was **the first mistake** mentioned in the Bible.
Did the serpent did something wrong? It seemed not, but yes it did!
It questioned God's rule, that human wouldn't surely die after eating fruit from the tree of knowledge. It's a huge wrong to question God's authority and God's rule, it was a sin!
Q: But is the term "sin" applicable for animals?

### Gen 3:6
> 3 main good effect of `tree of knowledge` .

### Gen 3:7
> They hadn't had sex yet to make baby. 
Before they know they're naked, they don't seem to have idea about it. 

### Genesis 3:8
> Q: Why is there a `sound of God’s walking`? 
God is spirit not physical, so what’s the meaning of God to walk here? 
When man sins, he’s afraid of president himself before God. Adam is the first one doing that.

### Genesis 3:16
> Woman’s desire shall be contrary to husband. 
Q: What’s the meaning of this ?

> Adam became like them, not all like them, but `in knowing good and evil`

### Genesis 3:24
> Q: What’s the purpose of setting them `to protect the tree of life`? 
Can’t God just remove it or just ruin the garden? 
Or does it even need a protection since God knows everything and can protect it from everywhere. Only thing I can guess of is that God just set a visible warning for human not to do stupid things to come, so that human won’t be hurt. 
So it’s because God love man, that’s why He set up the visible sign to keep them away. 

> Q: And again what’s meaning of maintaining the tree? 
All I can think of is that one day we will return ? 
Where is this garden? In my imagination, it’s a mystery place like the frog island in Naruto. 

> Only setup protection at `east of the gate`. 
Q: People only come from east would try to break it?

Answered: Cain was set to the east.
