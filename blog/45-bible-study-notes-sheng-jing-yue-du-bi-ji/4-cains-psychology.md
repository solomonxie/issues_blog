![Giovanni Domenico Ferretti, Cain and Abel, 1740](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/41817112-182d27a6-77c7-11e8-858a-fa764d6e57e2.png)


### Genesis 4:1
> Q: `Know his wife` is only meaning `making sex`? 
Or there’s something else more deep meaning in it? 

> Eve got baby because of `God’s help`. 
Q: What’s specific help is it?

### Genesis 4:7
> The `sin’s desire` is contrary to you. 
Q: Sin has desire?

>  “You shall rule over it!” “If you do well...” 
means `Cain didn’t do well on offering`. 
His offering must be less as good as Abel’s, or could be even worse, that he was not offering by will.

### Genesis 4:8
> Q: What did `Cain speak to Abel` before killed him?

### Genesis 4:14
> “Every one finds me...” 
Not specifically says human or animal. 
Most probably beast, because after Adam’s sin, animal start killing too. 
Beasts were all over the place , 
`Cain grew up in protection` had no way to know how to survive from them.

### Genesis 4:17
> That’s the place makes confusion: 
where did this woman come from ?
Answered later on Gen 5:4.

### Genesis 4:17
> He built a city, 
there couldn’t be `Cain’s one family`, 
must be a large group of people already existed there already.
