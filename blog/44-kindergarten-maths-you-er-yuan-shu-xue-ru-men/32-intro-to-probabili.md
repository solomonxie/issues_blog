# Intro to Probability
> It's easy but always confusing if you haven't yet totally understood it in the first place.

The very first thing to do for solving a probability problem, is to CATEGORISE the problem and apply different formula.

- One event
- One event repeats
- Independent events in sequence

## `ONE event`

- The probability of an event can only be **0 to 1**  (or 0% to 100%).
- The probability of event **`A`** is often written as **`P(A)`**.
- The probability of an event with condition is often written as **`P(condition)`**.

Common cases:
- Flip a coin:  P(head) = 1/2.
- Roll a die: P(>3) = 3/6

#### `Theoretical & experimental probabilities`
The formula `Fav outcomes / Total outcomes` only gives you the `Theoretical probability`.
But when you do some experiments, like flip a coin 10,000 times, 
and you may find out the probability of the result of experiments is way so different than the theoretical one.

### `One event repeats`
> It's asking for 

Example: `Roll a die 100 times, how many times will you get a number greater than 3?`
Answer: P(>3) = 3/6 *100
The probability is 50 times.

## `Multiple events`

### `Independent events in sequence`
> `A & B` happening

### `Independency`
> To understand probability, we really need to differentiate `independent events` and `dependent events`.

[Khan lecture: `Compound probability of independent events`.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/prob-comb/compound-probability-of-ind-events-using-mult-rule/v/compound-probability-of-independent-events)

`Coin flips` are INDEPENDENT events: 
What happens in the first flip in no way affects what happens in the second flip.

And this is actually one thing that many people don't realise.

#### `Gambler's Fallacy`
> There's someone who thinks, if he got a bunch of heads in a row, then all of a sudden, it becomes more likely on the next flip to get a tails. 

**THAT IS NOT THE CASE.**

**Every flip is an independent event.** What happened in the past in these flips does not affect the probabilities going forward.


### `Sample space`
A dummy method,  just to draw a table or a tree shows every outcome it could be, and pick out all favourable results.

First to notice that, it's **ONE** event.
