# Three Terms ratio problem

```c
It takes 54 minutes for 4 people to paint 6 walls.
How many minutes does it take 6 people to paint 7 walls?
```
- 4 p 1 wall: 54 / 6 = 9 minutes, then:
- 1 p 1 wall: 9 * 4 = 36 minutes, then: 
- 1 p 7 wall: 36 * 7 = 252 minutes, then:
- 6 p 7 wall: 252 / 6 = 42 minutes.

Note that, it cannot be easily get out the result, but only to understand the context and make it out step by step.
