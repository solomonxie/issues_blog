# `Polygons` (2D shapes)

[Refer to math is fun: `Polygons` (2D shapes)](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/polygons.html)

> A `Polygon` is any `flat shape` with `straight sides`.

## `Interior Angles` of Polygons

[Refer to math is fun: `Interior Angles` of Polygons](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/interior-angles-polygons.html)

> Each time we add a side (triangle to quadrilateral, quadrilateral to pentagon, etc), we add another 180° to the total

So the `sum of interior angles` of a 2D shape is shown below:
- Any Polygon: `(n-2)×180°`
- Ray: 0°
- Triangle: 180°
- Quadrilateral: 360°
- Pentagon: 540°
- Hexagon: 720°
- Septagon: 900°
- Octagon: 1080°
- Nonagon: 1260°

### `Regular Polygons`

> In a `regular polygon`, which means all interior angles have same measure, each angle equals to `sum ÷ n`.

For example, in a 3-sides triangle, if it's a regular triangle, aka. `equilateral triangle`, each angle should be `180°/3`, which is 60°.

## `Exterior angles` of Polygons
> The Exterior Angles of a Polygon **add up to `360°`**, regardless how many sides it has.

The first step is to turn each vertex (corner) into a coordinate,
