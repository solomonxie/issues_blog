# Transformations  (GEOMETRY)

> Transformation means something's changing, transforming. 

[Refer to Khan academy: Transformations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence)


Types of transformations:
- [`Translations`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-transformations-intro/a/intro-to-translations): Slide or move the shape. In geometry, a translation moves a thing up and down or left and right.
- [`Rotation`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-transformations-intro/a/intro-to-rotations): Turn or rotate the shape. In geometry, rotations make things turn in a cycle around a definite center point. 
- [`Reflection`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence/basic-geo-reflections/a/reflecting-shapes): Flip or mirror the shape. A reflection is a transformation that acts like a mirror: It swaps all pairs of points that are on exactly opposite sides of the line of reflection.
- [`Dilation`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geo-transformations-congruence/basic-geo-dilations/v/dilating-from-an-arbitrary-point-example): Expand or shrink the shape.

And,
you can group above types of transformations into two groups: `Rigid transformations` and `Dilations`

## [`Rigid transformations`](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Geometry/Transformations/TRRigidTransformations.html) and [`Congruent`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/congruent.html)

> `Rigitd transformations` means you play around the shape without expanding or shrinking it.
Or say, without dilation, all translation/rotation/reflection would be `rigid transformation`.

`Congruent` is the shape after you "rigid transformed`.
Or say, without dilation, after all translation/rotation/reflection, the shape is called "congruent" to the original shape.

## [`Dilations`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-dilations/v/example-identifying-the-center-of-dilation)

> `Dilation`, just a fancy word for "resizing", or "scaling".

Notice that: Dilation **DOES NOT** change any angle within the shape.
Don't get confused with a `horizontal stretch`, which **does change** both sides and angles.

### [`Similarity`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/similar.html)

> When you resize, or say dilate a shape, you call the new shape **`similar`** to the original one.
If nothing changed with the shape, you call it **`congruent`** to the original one.

### [`Scale factor`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-transformations/hs-geo-dilations/v/dilation-scale-factor)

> Means how much you scale the shape, like 2 times bigger, or 2/3 smaller.

Notice:
- The scale factor is of the length of the shape, NOT the area of it.

#### Scale factors and area
> When you scale the shape, the **area** of the new shape is **(scale facto)² times** to the original one.

[Khan lecture: Scale factors and area](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-seventh-grade-math/cc-7th-geometry/cc-7th-scale-drawings/v/scale-factors-and-area)

For Shape A and scaled shape A', it leads to two practical conclusions:
- If we know the `scale factor` is x, then the area of A is x² times to the original one.
- If we know the ratio `(area of A')` ÷ `(area of A)` is x, then the `scale factor` is `√x`


### Example

Solve:
- New area G is `1/9` of F
- So the `(scale factor)² = 1/9`, which results the `scale factor = 1/3`



### `Dilation Center`

>"Dilate the shape ABOUT a point P", means take the point as a center to dilate the shape.

How does it work? As the picture below, just simply **scale the distance** from each vertex(point) of the shape to the point.

#### How to find the dilation center?
> The point P and it's image and dilation center, should be IN ONE LINE !

> In the example below, you should forget about the `origin` but set the P point as origin and count the distance of each vertex of the triangle:
