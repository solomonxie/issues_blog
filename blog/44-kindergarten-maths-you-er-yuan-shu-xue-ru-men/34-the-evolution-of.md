## `Classification of numbers`

[Refer to Khan academy.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-eighth-grade-math/cc-8th-numbers-operations/cc-8th-irrational-numbers/a/classifying-numbers-review)

It's easy to classify most of the times, just to notice that:
- `Whole number` means `positive integers and zero`.
- `Rational number` must be able to represent as **a fraction of two numbers**.
