# Forms of linear equation

- [Slope-intersect form](http://www.mathsisfun.com/equation_of_line.html): 
`y = mx + b`, which `m` as `slope`, b as `y-intersect`.
This form is good for graphing a line with y-intersect and a certain slope.

- [Slope-point form](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/line-equation-point-slope.html): 
`y - b = m(x - a)`, which `m` as `slope`, (a, b) as a point on the line.
This form is good for draw a line through one or two points.

- [Standard form](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/two-var-linear-equations/standard-form/a/standard-form-review): 
`Ax + By = C`, which A,B,C are all `integers`.
This form is good for graphing a line through both x and y intersects.
