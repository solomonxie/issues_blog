# Triangle inequality theorem

[Refer to Math is fun: Triangle inequality theorem](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/triangle-inequality-theorem.html)

In a triangle, the sides always follow these two rules:
- Any side of a triangle is always **shorter** than the sum of the other two sides
- The third side must be also **larger** than the difference between the other two sides
