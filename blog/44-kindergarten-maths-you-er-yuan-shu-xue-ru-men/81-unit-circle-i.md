# `Unit circle`
> It's a fairly **fundamental** tool for solving `trigonometric problems`.

"Unit Circle is nothing more than a circle with a bunch of **Special Right Triangles.**"

Well, these special right triangles help us in connecting everything weâ€™ve learned so far about Reference Angles, Reference Triangles, and Trigonometric Functions, and puts them all together in one nice happy circle and allow us to find angles and lengths quickly.

## `Special right triangles`
`30-60-90 Triangle`:

## The Complete Unit Circle
> `X-axis` in the image is `Cosine-Axis`, and `Y-axis` is `Sine-Axis`.

## How to memorise the Unit Circle

[Refer to this PDF: unit-circle-radian-measure.pdf](https://github.com/solomonxie/solomonxie.github.io/files/1868499/unit-circle-radian-measure.pdf)

> Actually, we only need to remember the First Quadrant, and just REFLECT it about Y-axis and X-axis and the Origin, then we get all four quadrants of these special values.

Something important to remember:
- Each point on the `unit circle`, has other THREE `images` on the unit circle, so in total it's FOUR of them. Two are POSITIVE, other two are NEGATIVE.
