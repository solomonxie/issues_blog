## First to know the terms
It's only applicable to an `Right triangle`.  A right triangle is a triangle with a 90-degree angle.
The angle we pick out, is called `Θ`, theta. In `vector` related problems, it's also called the `direction angle`, see [this Khan practice](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/magnitude-direction/e/direction-angles).

The side opposite to that angle is called `Opposite`.
The side next to the angle is called `Adjacent`, "A-Jason-t".
The side is long is called `Hypotenuse`, "High-po-ten-news`.

## How to calculate sine, cosine and tangent of an angle 
REMEMBER SHORTCUT: `SOH-CAH-TOA`, pronounced "so-kah-tow-ah".
- `S`in = `O`pposite / `H`ypotenuse 
- `C`on = `A`djacent / `H`ypotenuse
- `T`an = `O`pposite / `A`djacent

## How to calculate the ratio of an angle?
We want to know what the ratio of an angle is, 60° or 59°?
If we know `tan(x) = 123`, whatever, then we can get it by `x = tan_inverse(123)`.
`tan_inverse(...)` or `tan⁻¹(...)` are the same.


## Reciprocal trig ratios: `Cosecant`, `Secant`, `Cotangent`

[Khan notes.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry-home/right-triangles-topic/reciprocal-trig-ratios-geo/a/reciprocal-trig-ratios)

- Cosecant: `csc(θ) = 1 / sin(θ)`
- Secant: `sec(θ) = 1 / cos(θ)`
- Cotangent: `cot(θ) = 1 / tan(θ)`
