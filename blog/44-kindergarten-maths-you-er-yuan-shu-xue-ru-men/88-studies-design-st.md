# Studies design (Statistics)

[Refer to Khan academy course.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/study-design-a1)

Types of studies:
- `Sample study`: To  estimate ONE certain parameter of a population.
- `Observational studies`: To **compare** TWO parameters of a population WITHOUT affecting them.
- `Experiments`: To compare TWO parameters of a population and DOES affecting one and does not affecting the other one.


## `Samples` or `surveys`
- Problem 1: Qualitative and quantitative data
- Problem 2: Representative samples
- Problem 3: Biased wording in survey questions
- Problem 4: Sampling methods
    - Systematic sampling: **100%** members of **ALL** groups chosen.
    - Stratified sampling: **Some** members from **ALL** groups chosen.
    - Random sampling: An adequate number of members chosen, each an equal chance of being in the sample.
    - Cluster sampling: **100%** members from **SOME** groups are chosen.

## `Observational studies` & `experiments`
- `Observational study`: Measure or survey members of a sample **WITHOUT** trying to affect them.
- `Controlled experiment`: **Apply** some treatment to one of the groups, while the other group **does not** receive the treatment.

## Notes
- Randomized experiments are designed to **`suggest causation`**
- `Correlation` is WEAKER than `causation`
- To answer a question about a causal relationship, we need to perform an experiment with a `treatment group` and a `control group`.
- While `sample study` need a part of relative members, `Observational study` need ALL members.
