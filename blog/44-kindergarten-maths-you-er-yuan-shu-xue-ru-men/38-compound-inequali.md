# `Compound inequalities`

[Refer to khan academy: `Compound inequalities`](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/one-variable-linear-inequalities/compound-inequalities/a/compound-inequalities-review)

Means an inequality that combines two simple inequalities, 
and our mission is to find out the solution of the compound inequality.

There are two kind of combination with relationship `AND` and `OR`:

## Solve compound inequalities
> Just solve each simple inequality get the `range` of `x`, then compare two ranges in graph or in mind to get conclusion. 
Mind that, if it's in AND case, you need to take the **overlap of two ranges;** If it's in OR case, you have to take **both two ranges as solution**.

Example for `OR`:

we get `x ≥ 2` and `x > 1`
Since it has overlap and it's in OR case, so we take all ranges, as `x > 1` can represent all.

Example for `no solution`:

To solve this and get:
`x > -1` and `x < -1`
You can't be greater and less than something at same time, so **no solution** for this case.
