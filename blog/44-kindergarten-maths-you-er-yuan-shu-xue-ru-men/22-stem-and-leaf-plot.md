# Stem and Leaf Plots (Stats)

> A `Stem and Leaf Plot` is a special table where each data value is split into a "stem" (the first digit or digits) and a "leaf" (usually the last digit).

In the above plot: 
- The `stem column` means the tens number of the whole number.
- The `row column` means the ones number of the whole number.
For example, the numbers of the second row represent: 12, 13, 15.

How the `Stem and Leaf Plot` represent numbers, it depends on the context. Stem can represents number of tens place, or ones place; Leaf can represents ones place or even decimal places.
