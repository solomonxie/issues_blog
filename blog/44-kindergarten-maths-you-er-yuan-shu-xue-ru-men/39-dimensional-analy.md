# `Dimensional analysis`
> Means `to convert a unit to another unit`.

[Refer to Wiki: `Dimensional analysis`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis)

For example, convert 60 km/h to 60000 m/h, or to 1 km/minute.
It works out many problem in physical science and engineering problems.

Another example, to convert 10 mile/hour to meter/second:

There're some tricks to convert units:

We need to convert both `L` and `min`, 
so for `L` we can multiply it by `1000 mL/L` just to remove `L`. Because `1000 mL/L` equals to 1, it's safe to do so.
Similarly, for `1/min` we can multiply it by `min/60sec` to remove `min`.
To see below:

to simplify this equation we will get:
