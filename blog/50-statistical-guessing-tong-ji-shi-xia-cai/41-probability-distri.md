It takes each Random Variable's value as an input, to form a distribution.
etc., values of a `Discrete Random Variable` can form a `Discrete Distribution`.

## Types of Probability Distribution
- `Discrete distribution`
- `Uniform distribution`
- `Bernoulli distribution`
- `Normal distribution`
- `Poisson distribution`

## A valid Probability Distribution
- All probabilities add up to 100%.
- All probabilities must be non-negative.
