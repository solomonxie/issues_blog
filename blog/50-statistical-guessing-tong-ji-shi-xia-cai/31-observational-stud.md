# Observational Study

WITHOUT affecting them, **deeply observe** whole (small) population.
The key is to **observe**.

[Refer to Khan academy: Worked example identifying observational study](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/gathering-data-ap/modal/v/worked-example-identifying-observational-study)

`Observational study` **DOES NOT** tell the `CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP`, but only to tell you if one parameter has **positive correlation** with another parameter or not.
