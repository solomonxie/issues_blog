- `Mean` is just an average of all numbers listed.
- `Median` is the middle positioned number in a ordered `number set` (means no duplicates). If there're two middles, then average them to get a median number.
- `Mode` is the number shows up most times in a list.

## Impact on median & mean

There're some common impact:
- Increasing an outlier: 
- Removing an outlier: 


## `Average`
> `Average` in statistics means bit different than just a arithmetic average.

`Average`: In stats, it means `typical` or `middle`, and could be represented by multiple ways:
- `Arithmetic mean`: Sum numbers and get average.
- `Median`: Sort numbers and get the MIDDLE one.
- `Mode`: A number repeats the most times in a dataset.
