# Examples of some categories of ML

## Unsupervised Learning examples
Only received data without any label or instruction, and you ask it to give you the answer.
- Customer. You give a whole book of customer contact list to it, and ask it to tell you what is each customer's salary?
- Language. So you're in a totally strange country and know nothing to their language, and there's no dictionary or any book as reference to your own language, then how do you understand them?
And that is what Unsupervised Learning is gonna do to solve.

## Reinforcement Learning examples
It will receive only SOME info, not by you but by itself, with some practice. 
- A toddler touch hot cup. Reinforcement learning is similar to Child Learning. A kid has curiosity to a hot cup and once he touches it he feels pain. So next time he remembers if he sees some white smoke come from the cup, he doesn't touch it.
- Playing game. You let the computer to play a game without telling it what's the move, and it starts to try every possible move, practise and practise, it remembers every 'fault move' it made and avoid it happens next time. 

## Supervised Learning examples
You feed it info with labels, right or wrong, then give a new data let it decide it's right or wrong.
- Spam and Ham emails. You give ton's of emails with classification label on each of it, let it learn , and let it predict a new email is a spam or ham.
